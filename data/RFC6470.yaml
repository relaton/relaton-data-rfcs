abstract:
- content: "<p>The Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) provides mechanisms to
    manipulate configuration datastores.  However, client applications often need
    to be aware of common events, such as a change in NETCONF server capabilities,
    that may impact management applications.  Standard mechanisms are needed to support
    the monitoring of the base system events within the NETCONF server.  This document
    defines a YANG module that allows a NETCONF client to receive notifications for
    some common system events. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
