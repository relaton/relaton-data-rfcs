abstract:
- content: "<p>The Delay-Tolerant Networking (DTN) architecture describes a type of
    challenged network in which communications may be significantly affected by long
    signal propagation delays, frequent link disruptions, or both. The unique characteristics
    of this environment require a unique approach to network management that supports
    asynchronous transport, autonomous local control, and a small footprint (in both
    resources and dependencies) so as to deploy on constrained devices.</p><p>This
    document describes a DTN Management Architecture (DTNMA) suitable for managing
    devices in any challenged environment but, in particular, those communicating
    using the DTN Bundle Protocol (BP). Operating over BP requires an architecture
    that neither presumes synchronized transport behavior nor relies on query-response
    mechanisms. Implementations compliant with this DTNMA should expect to successfully
    operate in extremely challenging conditions, such as over unidirectional links
    and other places where BP is the preferred transport.</p>"
