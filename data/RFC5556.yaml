abstract:
- content: "<p>Current IEEE 802.1 LANs use spanning tree protocols that have a number
    of challenges.  These protocols need to strictly avoid loops, even temporary ones,
    during route propagation, because of the lack of header loop detection support.
    \ Routing tends not to take full advantage of alternate paths, or even non-overlapping
    pairwise paths (in the case of spanning trees).  This document addresses these
    concerns and suggests applying modern network-layer routing protocols at the link
    layer.  This document assumes that solutions would not address issues of scalability
    beyond that of existing IEEE 802.1 bridged links, but that a solution would be
    backward compatible with 802.1, including hubs, bridges, and their existing plug-and-play
    capabilities.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
