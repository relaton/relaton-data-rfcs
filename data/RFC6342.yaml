abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobile Internet access from smartphones and other mobile devices is
    accelerating the exhaustion of IPv4 addresses.  IPv6 is widely seen as crucial
    for the continued operation and growth of the Internet, and in particular, it
    is critical in mobile networks.  This document discusses the issues that arise
    when deploying IPv6 in mobile networks.  Hence, this document can be a useful
    reference for service providers and network designers.  This document is not an
    Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
