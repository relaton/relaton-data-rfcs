abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides advice to network operators about deployment
    of the 6to4 technique for automatic tunneling of IPv6 over IPv4.  It is principally
    addressed to Internet Service Providers (ISPs), including those that do not yet
    support IPv6, and to Content Providers.  Some advice to implementers is also included.
    \ The intention of the advice is to minimize both user dissatisfaction and help-desk
    calls.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is
    published for informational purposes.</p>"
