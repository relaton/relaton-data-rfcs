abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the details of the Host Identity Protocol (HIP).
    HIP allows consenting hosts to securely establish and maintain shared IP-layer
    state, allowing separation of the identifier and locator roles of IP addresses,
    thereby enabling continuity of communications across IP address changes. HIP is
    based on a Diffie-Hellman key exchange, using public key identifiers from a new
    Host Identity namespace for mutual peer authentication. The protocol is designed
    to be resistant to denial-of-service (DoS) and man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks.
    When used together with another suitable security protocol, such as the Encapsulating
    Security Payload (ESP), it provides integrity protection and optional encryption
    for upper-layer protocols, such as TCP and UDP.</p><p>This document obsoletes
    RFC 5201 and addresses the concerns raised by the IESG, particularly that of crypto
    agility. It also incorporates lessons learned from the implementations of RFC
    5201.</p>"
