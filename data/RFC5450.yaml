abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a method to inform Real-time Transport Protocol
    (RTP) clients when RTP packets are transmitted at a time other than their 'nominal'
    transmission time.  It also provides a mechanism to provide improved inter-arrival
    jitter reports from the clients, that take into account the reported transmission
    times. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
