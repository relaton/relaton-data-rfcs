abstract:
- content: "<p>RFCs 3689 and 3690 detail requirements for an Emergency Telecommunications
    Service (ETS), of which an Internet Emergency Preparedness Service (IEPS) would
    be a part. Some of these types of services require call preemption; others require
    call queuing or other mechanisms. IEPS requires a Call Admission Control (CAC)
    procedure and a Per Hop Behavior (PHB) for the data that meet the needs of this
    architecture. Such a CAC procedure and PHB is appropriate to any service that
    might use H.323 or SIP to set up real-time sessions. The key requirement is to
    guarantee an elevated probability of call completion to an authorized user in
    time of crisis.</p><p>This document primarily discusses supporting ETS in the
    context of the US Government and NATO, because it focuses on the Multi-Level Precedence
    and Preemption (MLPP) and Government Emergency Telecommunication Service (GETS)
    standards. The architectures described here are applicable beyond these organizations.
    This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
