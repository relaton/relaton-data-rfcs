abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses security threats to network-based localized
    mobility management.  Threats may occur on two interfaces: the interface between
    a localized mobility anchor and a mobile access gateway, as well as the interface
    between a mobile access gateway and a mobile node.  Threats to the former interface
    impact the localized mobility management protocol itself.  This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.</p>"
