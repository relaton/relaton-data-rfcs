abstract:
- content: "<p>A common format simplifies exchange of secondary school academic transcripts
    via electronic mail.  Existing standards are applied to prevent unauthorized alteration
    of transcript content and to deliver transcripts directly and securely from each
    student to his or her chosen recipients.  By eliminating third-party intervention
    and surveillance, the defined protocol better protects student privacy and independence
    than does current practice.</p>"
