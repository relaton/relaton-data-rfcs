abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an RFC 3933 experiment in the Working Group
    formation process, known as the Exploratory Group. Exploratory Groups may be created
    as the first step toward Working Group formation, or as an intermediate step between
    a Birds of a Feather (BOF) session and Working Group creation. Exploratory Groups
    are focused on completion of prerequisites for Working Group formation, and as
    a result they have a short life-time, with limited opportunities for milestone
    extension. This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</p>"
