abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an RFC 3933 experiment in the Working Group
    formation process, known as the Exploratory Group.  Exploratory Groups may be
    created as the first step toward Working Group formation, or as an intermediate
    step between a Birds of a Feather (BOF) session and Working Group creation.  Exploratory
    Groups are focused on completion of prerequisites for Working Group formation,
    and as a result they have a short life-time, with limited opportunities for milestone
    extension.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</p>"
