abstract:
- content: "<p>Public Key Infrastructure using X.509 (PKIX) certificates are used
    for a number of purposes, the most significant of which is the authentication
    of domain names.  Thus, certification authorities (CAs) in the Web PKI are trusted
    to verify that an applicant for a certificate legitimately represents the domain
    name(s) in the certificate.  As of this writing, this verification is done through
    a collection of ad hoc mechanisms.  This document describes a protocol that a
    CA and an applicant can use to automate the process of verification and certificate
    issuance.  The protocol also provides facilities for other certificate management
    functions, such as certificate revocation.</p>"
