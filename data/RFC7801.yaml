abstract:
- content: <p>This document is intended to be a source of information about the Russian
    Federal standard GOST R 34.12-2015 describing the block cipher with a block length
    of n=128 bits and a key length of k=256 bits, which is also referred to as "Kuznyechik".  This
    algorithm is one of the set of Russian cryptographic standard algorithms (called
    GOST algorithms).</p>
