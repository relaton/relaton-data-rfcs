abstract:
- content: "<p>The RTP Profile for Audio and Video Conferences with Minimal Control
    (RTP/AVP) is the basis for many other profiles, such as the Secure Real-time Transport
    Protocol (RTP/SAVP), the Extended RTP Profile for Real-time Transport Control
    Protocol (RTCP)-Based Feedback (RTP/AVPF), and the Extended Secure RTP Profile
    for RTCP-Based Feedback (RTP/SAVPF).  This document updates RFC 3551, the RTP/AVP
    profile (and by extension, the profiles that build upon it), to reflect changes
    in audio codec usage since that document was originally published.</p>"
