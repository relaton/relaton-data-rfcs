abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a portion of the Management Information Base
    (MIB) for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP based internets. In
    particular, it defines objects for managing the Ethernet Wide Area Network (WAN)
    Interface Sublayer (WIS). The MIB module defined in this memo is an extension
    of the Synchronous Optical Network/Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SONET/SDH) Interface
    MIB and is implemented in conjunction with it and with the Ethernet-like Interface
    MIB, the 802.3 Medium Attachment Unit MIB, the Interfaces Group MIB, and the Inverted
    Stack Table MIB.</p>"
