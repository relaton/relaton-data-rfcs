abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies the "SVCB" ("Service Binding") and "HTTPS" DNS
    resource record (RR) types to facilitate the lookup of information needed to make
    connections to network services, such as for HTTP origins. SVCB records allow
    a service to be provided from multiple alternative endpoints, each with associated
    parameters (such as transport protocol configuration), and are extensible to support
    future uses (such as keys for encrypting the TLS ClientHello). They also enable
    aliasing of apex domains, which is not possible with CNAME. The HTTPS RR is a
    variation of SVCB for use with HTTP (see RFC 9110, "HTTP Semantics"). By providing
    more information to the client before it attempts to establish a connection, these
    records offer potential benefits to both performance and privacy.</p>
