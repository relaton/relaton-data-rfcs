abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposed two major changes to the current ARPANET host
    access protocol.  The first change will allow hosts to use logical addressing
    (i.e., host addresses that are independent of their physical location on the ARPANET)
    to communicate with each other, and the second will allow a host to shorten the
    amount of time that it may be blocked by its IMP after it presents a message to
    the network (currently, the IMP can block further input from a host for up to
    15 seconds).  See RFCs 852 and 851.</p>"
