abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines the second version of the Management Information
    Base (MIB-II) for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP- based internets.
    \ In particular, together with its companion memos which describe the structure
    of management information (RFC 1155) along with the network management protocol
    (RFC 1157) for TCP/IP- based internets, these documents provide a simple, workable
    architecture and system for managing TCP/IP-based internets and in particular
    the Internet community.  This document on MIB-II incorporates all of the technical
    content of RFC 1156 on MIB-I and extends it, without loss of compatibilty. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
