abstract:
- content: "<p>Requirements for providing the End-to-End (E2E) performance assurance
    are emerging within the service provider networks. While there are various technology
    solutions, there is no single solution that can fulfill these requirements for
    a native IP network. In particular, there is a need for a universal E2E solution
    that can cover both intra- and inter-domain scenarios.</p><p>One feasible E2E
    traffic-engineering solution is the addition of central control in a native IP
    network. This document describes various complex scenarios and simulation results
    when applying the Path Computation Element (PCE) in a native IP network. This
    solution, referred to as Centralized Control Dynamic Routing (CCDR), integrates
    the advantage of using distributed protocols and the power of a centralized control
    technology, providing traffic engineering for native IP networks in a manner that
    applies equally to intra- and inter-domain scenarios.</p>"
