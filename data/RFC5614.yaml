abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an extension of OSPFv3 to support mobile ad
    hoc networks (MANETs).  The extension, called OSPF-MDR, is designed as a new OSPF
    interface type for MANETs.  OSPF-MDR is based on the selection of a subset of
    MANET routers, consisting of MANET Designated Routers (MDRs) and Backup MDRs.
    \ The MDRs form a connected dominating set (CDS), and the MDRs and Backup MDRs
    together form a biconnected CDS for robustness.  This CDS is exploited in two
    ways.  First, to reduce flooding overhead, an optimized flooding procedure is
    used in which only (Backup) MDRs flood new link state advertisements (LSAs) back
    out the receiving interface; reliable flooding is ensured by retransmitting LSAs
    along adjacencies.  Second, adjacencies are formed only between (Backup) MDRs
    and a subset of their neighbors, allowing for much better scaling in dense networks.
    \ The CDS is constructed using 2-hop neighbor information provided in a Hello
    protocol extension.  The Hello protocol is further optimized by allowing differential
    Hellos that report only changes in neighbor states.  Options are specified for
    originating router-LSAs that provide full or partial topology information, allowing
    overhead to be reduced by advertising less topology information.  This memo defines
    an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</p>"
