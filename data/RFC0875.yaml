abstract:
- content: <p>This RFC is a discussion about the role of gateways in an internetwork,
    especially the problems of translating or mapping protocols between different
    protocol suites.  The discussion notes possible functionality mis-matches, undesirable
    routing "singularity points", flow control issues, and high cost of translating
    gateways.  Originally published as M82-51 by the MITRE Corporation, Bedford, Massachusetts.</p>
