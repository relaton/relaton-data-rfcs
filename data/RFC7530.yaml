abstract:
- content: "<p>The Network File System (NFS) version 4 protocol is a distributed file
    system protocol that builds on the heritage of NFS protocol version 2 (RFC 1094)
    and version 3 (RFC 1813). Unlike earlier versions, the NFS version 4 protocol
    supports traditional file access while integrating support for file locking and
    the MOUNT protocol. In addition, support for strong security (and its negotiation),
    COMPOUND operations, client caching, and internationalization has been added.
    Of course, attention has been applied to making NFS version 4 operate well in
    an Internet environment.</p><p>This document, together with the companion External
    Data Representation (XDR) description document, RFC 7531, obsoletes RFC 3530 as
    the definition of the NFS version 4 protocol.</p>"
