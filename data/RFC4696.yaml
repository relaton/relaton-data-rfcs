abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo offers non-normative implementation guidance for the Real-time
    Protocol (RTP) MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) payload format.  The
    memo presents its advice in the context of a network musical performance application.
    \ In this application two musicians, located in different physical locations,
    interact over a network to perform as they would if located in the same room.
    \ Underlying the performances are RTP MIDI sessions over unicast UDP.  Algorithms
    for sending and receiving recovery journals (the resiliency structure for the
    payload format) are described in detail.  Although the memo focuses on network
    musical performance, the presented implementation advice is relevant to other
    RTP MIDI applications. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
