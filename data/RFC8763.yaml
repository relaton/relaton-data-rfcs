abstract:
- content: "<p>Information-Centric Networking (ICN) is now reaching technological
    maturity after many years of fundamental research and experimentation. This document
    provides a number of deployment considerations in the interest of helping the
    ICN community move forward to the next step of live deployments. First, the major
    deployment configurations for ICN are described, including the key overlay and
    underlay approaches. Then, proposed deployment migration paths are outlined to
    address major practical issues, such as network and application migration. Next,
    selected ICN trial experiences are summarized. Finally, protocol areas that require
    further standardization are identified to facilitate future interoperable ICN
    deployments. This document is a product of the Information-Centric Networking
    Research Group (ICNRG).</p>"
