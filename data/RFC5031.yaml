abstract:
- content: "<p>The content of many communication services depends on the context,
    such as the user's location.  We describe a 'service' URN that allows well-known
    context-dependent services that can be resolved in a distributed manner to be
    identified.  Examples include emergency services, directory assistance, and call-before-you-dig
    hot lines. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
