abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines Management Information Bases (MIBs) for performing
    ping, traceroute, and lookup operations at a host. When managing a network, it
    is useful to be able to initiate and retrieve the results of ping or traceroute
    operations when they are performed at a remote host. A lookup capability is defined
    in order to enable resolution of either an IP address to an DNS name or a DNS
    name to an IP address at a remote host.</p><p>Currently, there are several enterprise-specific
    MIBs for performing remote ping or traceroute operations. The purpose of this
    memo is to define a standards-based solution to enable interoperability. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
