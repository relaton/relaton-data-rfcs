abstract:
- content: "<p>Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM), as per BCP 161,
    for data networks is often subject to the problem of circular dependencies when
    relying on connectivity provided by the network to be managed for the OAM purposes.</p><p>Provisioning
    while bringing up devices and networks tends to be more difficult to automate
    than service provisioning later on. Changes in core network functions impacting
    reachability cannot be automated because of ongoing connectivity requirements
    for the OAM equipment itself, and widely used OAM protocols are not secure enough
    to be carried across the network without security concerns.</p><p>This document
    describes how to integrate OAM processes with an autonomic control plane in order
    to provide stable and secure connectivity for those OAM processes. This connectivity
    is not subject to the aforementioned circular dependencies.</p>"
