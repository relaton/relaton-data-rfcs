abstract:
- content: <p>The Alternate-Marking method, as presented in RFC 8321, can only be
    applied to point-to-point flows, because it assumes that all the packets of the
    flow measured on one node are measured again by a single second node.  This document
    generalizes and expands this methodology to measure any kind of unicast flow whose
    packets can follow several different paths in the network -- in wider terms, a
    multipoint-to-multipoint network.  For this reason, the technique here described
    is called "Multipoint Alternate Marking".</p>
