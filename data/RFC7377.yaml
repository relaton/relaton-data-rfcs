abstract:
- content: "<p>The IMAP4 specification allows the searching of only the selected mailbox.
    \ A user often wants to search multiple mailboxes, and a client that wishes to
    support this must issue a series of SELECT and SEARCH commands, waiting for each
    to complete before moving on to the next.  This extension allows a client to search
    multiple mailboxes with one command, limiting the delays caused by many round
    trips and not requiring disruption of the currently selected mailbox.  This extension
    also uses MAILBOX, UIDVALIDITY, and TAG fields in ESEARCH responses, allowing
    a client to pipeline the searches if it chooses.  This document updates RFC 4466
    and obsoletes RFC 6237.</p>"
