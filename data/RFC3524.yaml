abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines an extension to the Session Description Protocol
    (SDP) grouping framework.  It allows requesting a group of media streams to be
    mapped into a single resource reservation flow.  The SDP syntax needed is defined,
    as well as a new "semantics" attribute called Single Reservation Flow (SRF). [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
