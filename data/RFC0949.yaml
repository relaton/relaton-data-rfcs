abstract:
- content: "<p>There are various contexts in which it would be desirable to have an
    FTP command that had the effect of the present STOR but rather than requiring
    the sender to specify a file name istead caused the resultant file to have a unique
    name relative to the current directory. This RFC proposes an extension to the
    File Transfer Protocol for the ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion
    and suggestions for improvements. See RFC-959.</p>"
