abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
    for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.  In particular,
    it defines a basic set of managed objects for SNMP-based (Simple Network Management
    Protocol) management of the Baseline Privacy Interface (BPI), which provides data
    privacy for DOCSIS 1.0 (Data-Over- Cable Service Interface Specifications) compliant
    Cable Modems and Cable Modem Termination Systems.  This MIB is defined as an extension
    to the DOCSIS Radio Frequency Interface MIB, RFC 2670.  This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.</p>"
