abstract:
- content: "<p>TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) facilitates loop-free
    connectivity to non-TRILL networks via a choice of an Appointed Forwarder for
    a set of VLANs.  Appointed Forwarders provide VLAN-based load sharing with an
    active-standby model.  High-performance applications require an active-active
    load-sharing model.  The active-active load-sharing model can be accomplished
    by representing any given non-TRILL network with a single virtual RBridge (also
    referred to as a virtual Routing Bridge or virtual TRILL switch).  Virtual representation
    of the non-TRILL network with a single RBridge poses serious challenges in multi-destination
    RPF (Reverse Path Forwarding) check calculations.  This document specifies required
    enhancements to build Coordinated Multicast Trees (CMT) within the TRILL campus
    to solve related RPF issues.  CMT, which only requires a software upgrade, provides
    flexibility to RBridges in selecting a desired path of association to a given
    TRILL multi-destination distribution tree.  This document updates RFC 6325.</p>"
