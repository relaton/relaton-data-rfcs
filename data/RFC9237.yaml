abstract:
- content: "<p>Information about which entities are authorized to perform what operations
    on which constituents of other entities is a crucial component of producing an
    overall system that is secure. Conveying precise authorization information is
    especially critical in highly automated systems with large numbers of entities,
    such as the Internet of Things.</p><p>This specification provides a generic information
    model and format for representing such authorization information, as well as two
    variants of a specific instantiation of that format for use with Representational
    State Transfer (REST) resources identified by URI path.</p>"
