abstract:
- content: <p>Digital signatures are used to sign messages, X.509 certificates, and
    Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs).  This document updates the "Algorithms and
    Identifiers for the Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate
    Revocation List (CRL) Profile" (RFC 3279) and describes the conventions for using
    the SHAKE function family in Internet X.509 certificates and revocation lists
    as one-way hash functions with the RSA Probabilistic signature and Elliptic Curve
    Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) signature algorithms.  The conventions for
    the associated subject public keys are also described.</p>
