abstract:
- content: '<p>Over the past few years, the number of RFCs that define and use IPsec
    and Internet Key Exchange (IKE) has greatly proliferated. This is complicated
    by the fact that these RFCs originate from numerous IETF working groups: the original
    IPsec WG, its various spin-offs, and other WGs that use IPsec and/or IKE to protect
    their protocols'' traffic.</p><p>This document is a snapshot of IPsec- and IKE-related
    RFCs. It includes a brief description of each RFC, along with background information
    explaining the motivation and context of IPsec''s outgrowths and extensions. It
    obsoletes RFC 2411, the previous "IP Security Document Roadmap."</p><p>The obsoleted
    IPsec roadmap (RFC 2411) briefly described the interrelationship of the various
    classes of base IPsec documents. The major focus of RFC 2411 was to specify the
    recommended contents of documents specifying additional encryption and authentication
    algorithms. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it
    is published for informational purposes.</p>'
