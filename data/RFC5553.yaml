abstract:
- content: "<p>The paths taken by Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized
    MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic Engineering (TE) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) may be computed
    by Path Computation Elements (PCEs). Where the TE LSP crosses multiple domains,
    such as Autonomous Systems (ASes), the path may be computed by multiple PCEs that
    cooperate, with each responsible for computing a segment of the path.</p><p>To
    preserve confidentiality of topology within each AS, the PCEs support a mechanism
    to hide the contents of a segment of a path (such as the segment of the path that
    traverses an AS), called the Confidential Path Segment (CPS), by encoding the
    contents as a Path Key Subobject (PKS) and embedding this subobject within the
    result of its path computation.</p><p>This document describes how to carry Path
    Key Subobjects in the Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) Explicit Route Objects
    (EROs) and Record Route Objects (RROs) so as to facilitate confidentiality in
    the signaling of inter-domain TE LSPs. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
