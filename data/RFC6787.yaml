abstract:
- content: <p>The Media Resource Control Protocol Version 2 (MRCPv2) allows client
    hosts to control media service resources such as speech synthesizers, recognizers,
    verifiers, and identifiers residing in servers on the network.  MRCPv2 is not
    a "stand-alone" protocol -- it relies on other protocols, such as the Session
    Initiation Protocol (SIP), to coordinate MRCPv2 clients and servers and manage
    sessions between them, and the Session Description Protocol (SDP) to describe,
    discover, and exchange capabilities.  It also depends on SIP and SDP to establish
    the media sessions and associated parameters between the media source or sink
    and the media server.  Once this is done, the MRCPv2 exchange operates over the
    control session established above, allowing the client to control the media processing
    resources on the speech resource server. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
