abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of the TLS feature extension is to prevent downgrade attacks
    that are not otherwise prevented by the TLS protocol.  In particular, the TLS
    feature extension may be used to mandate support for revocation checking features
    in the TLS protocol such as Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) stapling.
    \ Informing clients that an OCSP status response will always be stapled permits
    an immediate failure in the case that the response is not stapled.  This in turn
    prevents a denial-of-service attack that might otherwise be possible.</p>"
