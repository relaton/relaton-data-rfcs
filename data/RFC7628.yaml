abstract:
- content: "<p>OAuth enables a third-party application to obtain limited access to
    a protected resource, either on behalf of a resource owner by orchestrating an
    approval interaction or by allowing the third-party application to obtain access
    on its own behalf.</p><p>This document defines how an application client uses
    credentials obtained via OAuth over the Simple Authentication and Security Layer
    (SASL) to access a protected resource at a resource server. Thereby, it enables
    schemes defined within the OAuth framework for non-HTTP-based application protocols.</p><p>Clients
    typically store the user's long-term credential. This does, however, lead to significant
    security vulnerabilities, for example, when such a credential leaks. A significant
    benefit of OAuth for usage in those clients is that the password is replaced by
    a shared secret with higher entropy, i.e., the token. Tokens typically provide
    limited access rights and can be managed and revoked separately from the user's
    long-term password.</p>"
