abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes the Network Time Protocol (NTP), specifies its
    formal structure and summarizes information useful for its implementation.  NTP
    provides the mechanisms to synchronize time and coordinate time distribution in
    a large, diverse internet operating at rates from mundane to lightwave.  It uses
    a returnable-time design in which a distributed subnet of time servers operating
    in a self- organizing, hierarchical master-slave configuration synchronizes logical
    clocks within the subnet and to national time standards via wire or radio.  The
    servers can also redistribute reference time via local routing algorithms and
    time daemons.  The NTP architectures, algorithms and protocols which have evolved
    over several years of implementation and refinement are described in this document.
    \ The prototype system, which has been in regular operation in the Internet for
    the last two years, is described in an Appendix along with performance data which
    shows that timekeeping accuracy throughout most portions of the Internet can be
    ordinarily maintained to within a few tens of milliseconds, even the cases of
    failure or disruption of clocks, time servers or nets.  This is a Draft Standard
    for an Elective protocol.</p>"
