abstract:
- content: "<p>The Verizon Wireless Dynamic Mobile IP Key Update procedure is a mechanism
    for distributing and updating Mobile IP (MIP) cryptographic keys in cdma2000(R)
    networks (including High Rate Packet Data, which is often referred to as 1xEV-DO).
    The Dynamic Mobile IP Key Update (DMU) procedure occurs between the MIP Mobile
    Node (MN) and RADIUS Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) Server
    via a cdma2000(R) Packet Data Serving Node (PDSN) that is acting as a Mobile IP
    Foreign Agent (FA).</p><p>cdma2000(R) is a registered trademark of the Telecommunications
    Industry Association (TIA). This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
