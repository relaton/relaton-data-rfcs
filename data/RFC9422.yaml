abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a LIMITS extension for the Simple Mail Transfer
    Protocol (SMTP), including submission, as well as the Local Mail Transfer Protocol
    (LMTP). It also defines an associated limit registry. The extension provides the
    means for an SMTP, submission, or LMTP server to inform the client of limits the
    server intends to apply to the protocol during the current session. The client
    is then able to adapt its behavior in order to conform to those limits.</p>"
