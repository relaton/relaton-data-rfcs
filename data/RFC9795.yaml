abstract:
- content: <p>This document extends Personal Assertion Token (PASSporT), a token for
    conveying cryptographically signed call information about personal communications,
    to include rich metadata about a call and caller that can be signed and integrity
    protected, transmitted, and subsequently rendered to the called party. This framework
    is intended to include and extend caller- and call-specific information beyond
    human-readable display name, comparable to the "Caller ID" function common on
    the telephone network. It is also enhanced with an integrity mechanism that is
    designed to protect the authoring and transport of this information for different
    authoritative use cases.</p>
