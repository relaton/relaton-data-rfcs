abstract:
- content: <p>RFC 8226 specifies the use of certificates for Secure Telephone Identity
    Credentials; these certificates are often called "Secure Telephone Identity Revisited
    (STIR) Certificates".  RFC 8226 provides a certificate extension to constrain
    the JSON Web Token (JWT) claims that can be included in the Personal Assertion
    Token (PASSporT), as defined in RFC 8225.  If the PASSporT signer includes a JWT
    claim outside the constraint boundaries, then the PASSporT recipient will reject
    the entire PASSporT.  This document updates RFC 8226; it provides all of the capabilities
    available in the original certificate extension as well as an additional way to
    constrain the allowable JWT claims.  The enhanced extension can also provide a
    list of claims that are not allowed to be included in the PASSporT.</p>
