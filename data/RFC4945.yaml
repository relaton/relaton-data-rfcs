abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet Key Exchange (IKE) and Public Key Infrastructure for X.509
    (PKIX) certificate profile both provide frameworks that must be profiled for use
    in a given application.  This document provides a profile of IKE and PKIX that
    defines the requirements for using PKI technology in the context of IKE/IPsec.
    \ The document complements protocol specifications such as IKEv1 and IKEv2, which
    assume the existence of public key certificates and related keying materials,
    but which do not address PKI issues explicitly.  This document addresses those
    issues.  The intended audience is implementers of PKI for IPsec. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
