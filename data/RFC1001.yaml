abstract:
- content: '<p>This RFC defines a proposed standard protocol to support NetBIOS services
    in a TCP/IP environment.  Both local network and internet operation are supported.  Various
    node types are defined to accommodate local and internet topologies and to allow
    operation with or without the use of IP broadcast.  This RFC describes the NetBIOS-over-TCP
    protocols in a general manner, emphasizing the underlying ideas and techniques.  Detailed
    specifications are found in a companion RFC, "Protocol Standard For a NetBIOS
    Service on a TCP/UDP Transport: Detailed Specifications".</p>'
