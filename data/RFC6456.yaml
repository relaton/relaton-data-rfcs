abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the application of MPLS multi-segment pseudowires
    (MS-PWs) in a dual-technology environment comprising a Passive Optical Network
    (PON) and an MPLS Packet Switched Network (PSN).</p><p>PON technology may be used
    in mobile backhaul networks to support the end segments closest to the aggregation
    devices. In these cases, there may be a very large number of pseudowire (PW) Terminating
    Provider Edge (T-PE) nodes. The MPLS control plane could be used to provision
    these end segments, but support for the necessary protocols would complicate the
    management of the T-PEs and would significantly increase their expense. Alternatively,
    static, or management plane, configuration could be used to configure the end
    segments, but the very large number of such segments in a PON places a very heavy
    burden on the network manager.</p><p>This document describes how to set up the
    end segment of an end-to- end MPLS PW over a Gigabit-capable Passive Optical Network
    (G-PON) or 10 Gigabit-capable Passive Optical Network (XG-PON) using the G-PON
    and XG-PON management protocol, Optical Network Termination Management and Control
    Interface (OMCI). This simplifies and speeds up PW provisioning compared with
    manual configuration.</p><p>This document also shows how an MS-PW may be constructed
    from an end segment supported over a PON, and switched to one or more segments
    supported over an MPLS PSN. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;
    it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
