abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents the RACK-TLP loss detection algorithm for TCP.
    \ RACK-TLP uses per-segment transmit timestamps and selective acknowledgments
    (SACKs) and has two parts.  Recent Acknowledgment (RACK) starts fast recovery
    quickly using time-based inferences derived from acknowledgment (ACK) feedback,
    and Tail Loss Probe (TLP) leverages RACK and sends a probe packet to trigger ACK
    feedback to avoid retransmission timeout (RTO) events.  Compared to the widely
    used duplicate acknowledgment (DupAck) threshold approach, RACK-TLP detects losses
    more efficiently when there are application-limited flights of data, lost retransmissions,
    or data packet reordering events.  It is intended to be an alternative to the
    DupAck threshold approach.</p>"
