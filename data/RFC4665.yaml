- content: "<p>This document provides requirements for Layer 2 Provider-Provisioned
    Virtual Private Networks (L2VPNs).  It first provides taxonomy and terminology
    and states generic and general service requirements.  It covers point-to-point
    VPNs, referred to as Virtual Private Wire Service (VPWS), as well as multipoint-to-multipoint
    VPNs, also known as Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS).  Detailed requirements
    are expressed from both a customer as well as a service provider perspectives.
    \ This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
