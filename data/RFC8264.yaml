abstract:
- content: <p>Application protocols using Unicode code points in protocol strings
    need to properly handle such strings in order to enforce internationalization
    rules for strings placed in various protocol slots (such as addresses and identifiers)
    and to perform valid comparison operations (e.g., for purposes of authentication
    or authorization).  This document defines a framework enabling application protocols
    to perform the preparation, enforcement, and comparison of internationalized strings
    ("PRECIS") in a way that depends on the properties of Unicode code points and
    thus is more agile with respect to versions of Unicode.  As a result, this framework
    provides a more sustainable approach to the handling of internationalized strings
    than the previous framework, known as Stringprep (RFC 3454).  This document obsoletes
    RFC 7564.</p>
