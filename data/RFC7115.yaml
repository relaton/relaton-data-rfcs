- content: "<p>Deployment of BGP origin validation that is based on the Resource Public
    Key Infrastructure (RPKI) has many operational considerations. This document attempts
    to collect and present those that are most critical. It is expected to evolve
    as RPKI-based origin validation continues to be deployed and the dynamics are
    better understood.</p>"
