abstract:
- content: "<p>A link indication represents information provided by the link layer
    to higher layers regarding the state of the link. This document describes the
    role of link indications within the Internet architecture. While the judicious
    use of link indications can provide performance benefits, inappropriate use can
    degrade both robustness and performance. This document summarizes current proposals,
    describes the architectural issues, and provides examples of appropriate and inappropriate
    uses of link indications. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
