abstract:
- content: "<p>The IS-IS routing protocol (Intermediate System to Intermediate System,
    ISO 10589) requires reliable protocols at the link layer for point-to-point links.
    As a result, it does not use a three-way handshake when establishing adjacencies
    on point-to-point media. This paper defines a backward-compatible extension to
    the protocol that provides for a three-way handshake. It is fully interoperable
    with systems that do not support the extension.</p><p>Additionally, the extension
    allows the robust operation of more than 256 point-to-point links on a single
    router.</p><p>This extension has been implemented by multiple router vendors;
    this paper is provided to the Internet community in order to allow interoperable
    implementations to be built by other vendors. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
