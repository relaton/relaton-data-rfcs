abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines requirements for standards specifications for
    Energy Management. The requirements defined in this document are concerned with
    monitoring functions as well as control functions. Monitoring functions include
    identifying energy-managed devices and their components, as well as monitoring
    their Power States, Power Inlets, Power Outlets, actual power, Power Attributes,
    received energy, provided energy, and contained batteries. Control functions include
    such functions as controlling power supply and Power State of energy-managed devices
    and their components.</p><p>This document does not specify the features that must
    be implemented by compliant implementations but rather lists features that must
    be supported by standards for Energy Management.</p>"
