abstract:
- content: "<p>Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Switched Path (LSP) ping
    and traceroute are methods used to test Equal-Cost Multipath (ECMP) paths. Ping
    is known as a connectivity-verification method and traceroute is known as a fault-isolation
    method, as described in RFC 4379. When an LSP is signaled using the Entropy Label
    (EL) described in RFC 6790, the ability for LSP ping and traceroute operations
    to discover and exercise ECMP paths is lost for scenarios where Label Switching
    Routers (LSRs) apply different load-balancing techniques. One such scenario is
    when some LSRs apply EL-based load balancing while other LSRs apply load balancing
    that is not EL based (e.g., IP). Another scenario is when an EL-based LSP is stitched
    with another LSP that can be EL based or not EL based.</p><p>This document extends
    the MPLS LSP ping and traceroute multipath mechanisms in RFC 6424 to allow the
    ability of exercising LSPs that make use of the EL. This document updates RFC
    6790.</p>"
