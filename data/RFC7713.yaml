abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes an abstract mechanism by which senders inform
    the network about the congestion recently encountered by packets in the same flow.  Today,
    network elements at any layer may signal congestion to the receiver by dropping
    packets or by Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) markings, and the receiver
    passes this information back to the sender in transport-layer feedback.  The mechanism
    described here enables the sender to also relay this congestion information back
    into the network in-band at the IP layer, such that the total amount of congestion
    from all elements on the path is revealed to all IP elements along the path, where
    it could, for example, be used to provide input to traffic management.  This mechanism
    is called Congestion Exposure, or ConEx.  The companion document, "Congestion
    Exposure (ConEx) Concepts and Use Cases" (RFC 6789), provides the entry point
    to the set of ConEx documentation.</p>
