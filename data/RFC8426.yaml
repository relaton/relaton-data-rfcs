abstract:
- content: "<p>Operators are looking to introduce services over Segment Routing (SR)
    Label Switched Paths (LSPs) in networks running Resource Reservation Protocol
    - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) LSPs. In some instances, operators are also migrating
    existing services from RSVP-TE to SR LSPs. For example, there might be certain
    services that are well suited for SR and need to coexist with RSVP-TE in the same
    network. Such introduction or migration of traffic to SR might require coexistence
    with RSVP-TE in the same network for an extended period of time, depending on
    the operator's intent. The following document provides solution options for keeping
    the traffic engineering database consistent across the network, accounting for
    the different bandwidth utilization between SR and RSVP-TE.</p>"
