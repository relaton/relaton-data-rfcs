abstract:
- content: "<p>This document lists security threats related to IPv6 multihoming. Multihoming
    can introduce new opportunities to redirect packets to different, unintended IP
    addresses.</p><p>The intent is to look at how IPv6 multihoming solutions might
    make the Internet less secure; we examine threats that are inherent to all IPv6
    multihoming solutions rather than study any specific proposed solution. The threats
    in this document build upon the threats discovered and discussed as part of the
    Mobile IPv6 work. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
