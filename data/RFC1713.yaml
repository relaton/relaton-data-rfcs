abstract:
- content: "<p>Although widely used (and most of the times unnoticed), DNS (Domain
    Name System) is too much overlooked, in the sense that people, especially administrators,
    tend to ignore possible anomalies as long as applications that need name-to-address
    mapping continue to work.  This document presents some tools available for domain
    administrators to detect and correct those anomalies.  This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.  This memo does not specify an Internet standard of
    any kind.</p>"
