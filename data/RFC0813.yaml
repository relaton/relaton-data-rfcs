abstract:
- content: "<p>This RFC describes implementation strategies to deal with two mechanisms
    in TCP, the window and the acknowledgement.  It also presents a particular set
    of algorithms which have received testing in the field, and which appear to work
    properly with each other.  With more experience, these algorithms may become part
    of the formal specification, until such time their use is recommended.</p>"
