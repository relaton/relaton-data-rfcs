abstract:
- content: "<p>This memorandum describes the Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP),
    which is an adaptation of the Network Time Protocol (NTP) used to synchronize
    computer clocks in the Internet. This memorandum does not obsolete or update any
    RFC. This memo provides information for the Internet community. It does not specify
    an Internet standard. Discussion of the standardization process and the RFC document
    series is presented first, followed by an explanation of the terms. Sections 6.2
    - 6.9 contain the lists of protocols in each stage of standardization. Finally
    come pointers to references and contacts for further information. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
