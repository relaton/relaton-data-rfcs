abstract:
- content: "<p>For Internet-centric usage, the number of SIP-required standards for
    presence and IM and audio/video communications can be drastically smaller than
    what has been published by using only the rendezvous and session-initiation capabilities
    of SIP. The simplification is achieved by avoiding the emulation of telephony
    and its model of the intelligent network. 'Simple SIP' relies on powerful computing
    endpoints. Simple SIP desktop applications can be combined with rich Internet
    applications (RIAs). Significant telephony features may also be implemented in
    the endpoints.</p><p>This approach for SIP reduces the number of SIP standards
    with which to comply -- from roughly 100 currently, and still growing, to about
    11.</p><p>References for NAT traversal and for security are also provided. This
    memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
