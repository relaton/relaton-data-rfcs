abstract:
- content: "<p>When a Location Information Server receives a request for location
    information (using the locationRequest message), described in the base HTTP-Enabled
    Location Delivery (HELD) specification, it uses the source IP address of the arriving
    message as a pointer to the location determination process. This is sufficient
    in environments where the location of a Device can be determined based on its
    IP address.</p><p>Two additional use cases are addressed by this document. In
    the first, location configuration requires additional or alternative identifiers
    from the source IP address provided in the request. In the second, an entity other
    than the Device requests the location of the Device.</p><p>This document extends
    the HELD protocol to allow the location request message to carry Device identifiers.
    Privacy and security considerations describe the conditions where requests containing
    identifiers are permitted. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
