abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 5485 specifies the conventions for digital signatures on Internet-Drafts.
    The Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) is used to create a detached signature,
    which is stored in a separate companion file so that no existing utilities are
    impacted by the addition of the digital signature.</p><p>The RFC Editor recently
    published the first RFC that includes non- ASCII characters in a text file. The
    conventions specified in RFC 7997 were followed. We assume that non-ASCII characters
    will soon start appearing in Internet-Drafts as well. This document updates the
    handling of digital signatures on Internet-Drafts that contain non-ASCII characters
    in a text file.</p><p>This document updates RFC 5485.</p>"
