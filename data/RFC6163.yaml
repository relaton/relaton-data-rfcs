abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a framework for applying Generalized Multi-Protocol
    Label Switching (GMPLS) and the Path Computation Element (PCE) architecture to
    the control of Wavelength Switched Optical Networks (WSONs). In particular, it
    examines Routing and Wavelength Assignment (RWA) of optical paths.</p><p>This
    document focuses on topological elements and path selection constraints that are
    common across different WSON environments; as such, it does not address optical
    impairments in any depth. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;
    it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
