abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides the network management framework for the Transport
    Profile for Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS-TP).</p><p>This framework relies
    on the management terminology from the ITU-T to describe the management architecture
    that could be used for an MPLS-TP management network.</p><p>The management of
    the MPLS-TP network could be based on multi-tiered distributed management systems.
    This document provides a description of the network and element management architectures
    that could be applied and also describes heuristics associated with fault, configuration,
    and performance aspects of the management system.</p><p>This document is a product
    of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) / International Telecommunication
    Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS
    Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the capabilities
    and functionalities of a packet transport network. This document is not an Internet
    Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
