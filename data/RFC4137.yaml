abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes a set of state machines for Extensible Authentication
    Protocol (EAP) peer, EAP stand-alone authenticator (non-pass-through), EAP backend
    authenticator (for use on Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA)
    servers), and EAP full authenticator (for both local and pass-through). This set
    of state machines shows how EAP can be implemented to support deployment in either
    a peer/authenticator or peer/authenticator/AAA Server environment. The peer and
    stand-alone authenticator machines are illustrative of how the EAP protocol defined
    in RFC 3748 may be implemented. The backend and full/pass-through authenticators
    illustrate how EAP/AAA protocol support defined in RFC 3579 may be implemented.
    Where there are differences, RFC 3748 and RFC 3579 are authoritative.</p><p>The
    state machines are based on the EAP "Switch" model. This model includes events
    and actions for the interaction between the EAP Switch and EAP methods. A brief
    description of the EAP "Switch" model is given in the Introduction section.</p><p>The
    state machine and associated model are informative only. Implementations may achieve
    the same results using different methods. This memo provides information for the
    Internet community.</p>
