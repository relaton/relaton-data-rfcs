- content: "<p>This memo documents IETF consensus for Internationalized Domain Names
    for Applications (IDNA) derived character properties related to the three code
    points, existing in Unicode 5.2, that changed property values when version 6.0
    was released.  The consensus is that no update is needed to RFC 5892 based on
    the changes made in Unicode 6.0. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
