abstract:
- content: "<p>This document obsoletes RFC 3330.  It describes the global and other
    specialized IPv4 address blocks that have been assigned by the Internet Assigned
    Numbers Authority (IANA).  It does not address IPv4 address space assigned to
    operators and users through the Regional Internet Registries, nor does it address
    IPv4 address space assigned directly by IANA prior to the creation of the Regional
    Internet Registries.  It also does not address allocations or assignments of IPv6
    addresses or autonomous system numbers.  This memo documents an Internet Best
    Current Practice.</p>"
