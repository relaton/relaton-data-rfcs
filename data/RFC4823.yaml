abstract:
- content: "<p>This Applicability Statement (AS) describes how to exchange structured
    business data securely using the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) for XML, Binary,
    Electronic Data Interchange (EDI - ANSI X12 or UN/EDIFACT), or other data used
    for business-to-business data interchange for which MIME packaging can be accomplished
    using standard MIME content types.  Authentication and data confidentiality are
    obtained by using Cryptographic Message Syntax (S/MIME) security body parts.  Authenticated
    acknowledgements employ multipart/signed replies to the original message.  This
    memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
