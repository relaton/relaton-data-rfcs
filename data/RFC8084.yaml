abstract:
- content: <p>This document explains what is meant by the term "network transport
    Circuit Breaker".  It describes the need for Circuit Breakers (CBs) for network
    tunnels and applications when using non-congestion- controlled traffic and explains
    where CBs are, and are not, needed.  It also defines requirements for building
    a CB and the expected outcomes of using a CB within the Internet.</p>
