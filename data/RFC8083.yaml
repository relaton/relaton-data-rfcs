abstract:
- content: "<p>The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is widely used in telephony,
    video conferencing, and telepresence applications. Such applications are often
    run on best-effort UDP/IP networks. If congestion control is not implemented in
    these applications, then network congestion can lead to uncontrolled packet loss
    and a resulting deterioration of the user's multimedia experience. The congestion
    control algorithm acts as a safety measure by stopping RTP flows from using excessive
    resources and protecting the network from overload. At the time of this writing,
    however, while there are several proprietary solutions, there is no standard algorithm
    for congestion control of interactive RTP flows.</p><p>This document does not
    propose a congestion control algorithm. It instead defines a minimal set of RTP
    circuit breakers: conditions under which an RTP sender needs to stop transmitting
    media data to protect the network from excessive congestion. It is expected that,
    in the absence of long-lived excessive congestion, RTP applications running on
    best-effort IP networks will be able to operate without triggering these circuit
    breakers. To avoid triggering the RTP circuit breaker, any Standards Track congestion
    control algorithms defined for RTP will need to operate within the envelope set
    by these RTP circuit breaker algorithms.</p>"
