abstract:
- content: "<p>The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) is used
    to convey path computation requests and responses both between Path Computation
    Clients (PCCs) and Path Computation Elements (PCEs) and between cooperating PCEs.
    In PCEP, the path computation requests carry details of the constraints and objective
    functions that the PCC wishes the PCE to apply in its computation.</p><p>This
    document defines a facility to carry vendor-specific information in PCEP using
    a dedicated object and a new Type-Length-Value (TLV) that can be carried in any
    PCEP object that supports TLVs.</p><p>This document obsoletes RFC 7150. The only
    changes from that document are a clarification of the use of the new Type-Length-Value
    and the allocation of a different code point for the VENDOR-INFORMATION object.</p>"
