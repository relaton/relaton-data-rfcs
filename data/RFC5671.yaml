abstract:
- content: "<p>The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides path computation functions
    in support of traffic engineering in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and
    Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks.</p><p>Extensions to the MPLS and GMPLS signaling
    and routing protocols have been made in support of point-to-multipoint (P2MP)
    Traffic Engineered (TE) Label Switched Paths (LSPs).</p><p>This document examines
    the applicability of PCE to path computation for P2MP TE LSPs in MPLS and GMPLS
    networks. It describes the motivation for using a PCE to compute these paths and
    examines which of the PCE architectural models are appropriate. This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.</p>"
