abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines a new exchange, called "Intermediate Exchange",
    for the Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2).  This exchange can be
    used for transferring large amounts of data in the process of IKEv2 Security Association
    (SA) establishment.  An example of the need to do this is using key exchange methods
    resistant to Quantum Computers (QCs) for IKE SA establishment.  The Intermediate
    Exchange makes it possible to use the existing IKE fragmentation mechanism (which
    cannot be used in the initial IKEv2 exchange), helping to avoid IP fragmentation
    of large IKE messages if they need to be sent before IKEv2 SA is established.</p>
