abstract:
- content: "<p>Despite its name, DNS-Based Service Discovery (DNS-SD) can use naming
    systems other than DNS when looking for services.  Moreover, when it uses DNS,
    DNS-SD uses the full capability of DNS, rather than using a subset of available
    octets.  This is of particular relevance where some environments use DNS labels
    that conform to Internationalized Domain Names for Applications (IDNA), and other
    environments use labels containing Unicode characters (such as containing octets
    corresponding to characters encoded as UTF-8).  In order for DNS-SD to be used
    effectively in environments where multiple different name systems and conventions
    for their operation are in use, it is important to attend to differences in the
    underlying technology and operational environment.  This memo presents an outline
    of the requirements for the selection of labels for conventional DNS and other
    resolution systems when they are expected to interoperate in this manner.</p>"
