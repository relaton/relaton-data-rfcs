abstract:
- content: "<p>The ability to compute shortest constrained Traffic Engineering Label
    Switched Paths (TE LSPs) in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized
    MPLS (GMPLS) networks across multiple domains has been identified as a key requirement.
    \ In this context, a domain is a collection of network elements within a common
    sphere of address management or path computational responsibility such as an Interior
    Gateway Protocol (IGP) area or an Autonomous System (AS).  This document specifies
    a representation and encoding of a domain sequence, which is defined as an ordered
    sequence of domains traversed to reach the destination domain to be used by Path
    Computation Elements (PCEs) to compute inter-domain constrained shortest paths
    across a predetermined sequence of domains.  This document also defines new subobjects
    to be used to encode domain identifiers.</p>"
