abstract:
- content: <p>The Path Computation Element (PCE) is a functional component capable
    of selecting paths through a traffic engineering (TE) network. These paths may
    be supplied in response to requests for computation or may be unsolicited requests
    issued by the PCE to network elements. Both approaches use the PCE Communication
    Protocol (PCEP) to convey the details of the computed path.</p><p>Traffic flows
    may be categorized and described using "Flow Specifications". RFC 8955 defines
    the Flow Specification and describes how Flow Specification components are used
    to describe traffic flows. RFC 8955 also defines how Flow Specifications may be
    distributed in BGP to allow specific traffic flows to be associated with routes.</p><p>This
    document specifies a set of extensions to PCEP to support dissemination of Flow
    Specifications. This allows a PCE to indicate what traffic should be placed on
    each path that it is aware of.</p><p>The extensions defined in this document include
    the creation, update, and withdrawal of Flow Specifications via PCEP and can be
    applied to tunnels initiated by the PCE or to tunnels where control is delegated
    to the PCE by the Path Computation Client (PCC). Furthermore, a PCC requesting
    a new path can include Flow Specifications in the request to indicate the purpose
    of the tunnel allowing the PCE to factor this into the path computation.</p>
