abstract:
- content: "<p>The IPv6 default address selection document (RFC 3484) describes the
    rules for selecting source and destination IPv6 addresses, and indicates that
    applications should be able to reverse the sense of some of the address selection
    rules through some unspecified API.  However, no such socket API exists in the
    basic (RFC 3493) or advanced (RFC 3542) IPv6 socket API documents.  This document
    fills that gap partially by specifying new socket-level options for source address
    selection and flags for the getaddrinfo() API to specify address selection based
    on the source address preference in accordance with the socket-level options that
    modify the default source address selection algorithm.  The socket API described
    in this document will be particularly useful for IPv6 applications that want to
    choose between temporary and public addresses, and for Mobile IPv6 aware applications
    that want to use the care-of address for communication.  It also specifies socket
    options and flags for selecting Cryptographically Generated Address (CGA) or non-CGA
    source addresses.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
