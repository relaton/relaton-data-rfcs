abstract:
- content: <p>This memo documents a long-standing technique, supported by a large
    number of mail servers, which allows users to be notified of new mail. In addition
    to server support, there are a number of clients that support this, ranging from
    full email clients to specialized clients whose only purpose is to receive new
    mail notifications and alert a mail client.</p><p>In brief, the server sends the
    string "nm_notifyuser" CRLF to the finger port on the IP address (either configured
    or last used) of the user who has received new mail. This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.</p>
