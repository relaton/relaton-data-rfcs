abstract:
- content: "<p>Deployment of BGP origin validation based on Resource Public Key Infrastructure
    (RPKI) is hampered by, among other things, vendor misimplementations in two critical
    areas: which routes are validated and whether policy is applied when not specified
    by configuration. This document is meant to clarify possible misunderstandings
    causing those misimplementations; it thus updates RFC 6811 by clarifying that
    all prefixes should have their validation state set and that policy must not be
    applied without operator configuration.</p>"
