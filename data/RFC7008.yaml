abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the KCipher-2 encryption algorithm.  KCipher-2
    is a stream cipher with a 128-bit key and a 128-bit initialization vector.  Since
    the algorithm for KCipher-2 was published in 2007, security and efficiency have
    been rigorously evaluated through academic and industrial studies.  As of the
    publication of this document, no security vulnerabilities have been found.  KCipher-2
    offers fast encryption and decryption by means of simple operations that enable
    efficient implementation.  KCipher-2 has been used for industrial applications,
    especially for mobile health monitoring and diagnostic services in Japan.</p>"
