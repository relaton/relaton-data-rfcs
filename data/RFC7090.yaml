abstract:
- content: <p>After an emergency call is completed (terminated either prematurely
    by the emergency caller or normally by the call taker), the call taker may feel
    the need for further communication. For example, the call may have been dropped
    by accident without the call taker having sufficient information about the current
    state of an accident victim. A call taker may trigger a callback to the emergency
    caller using the contact information provided with the initial emergency call.
    This callback could, under certain circumstances, be treated like any other call
    and, as a consequence, it may get blocked by authorization policies or may get
    forwarded to an answering machine.</p><p>The IETF emergency services architecture
    specification already offers a solution approach for allowing Public Safety Answering
    Point (PSAP) callbacks to bypass authorization policies in order to reach the
    caller without unnecessary delays. Unfortunately, the specified mechanism only
    supports limited scenarios. This document discusses shortcomings of the current
    mechanisms and illustrates additional scenarios where better-than-normal call
    treatment behavior would be desirable. We describe a solution based on a new header
    field value for the SIP Priority header field, called "psap-callback", to mark
    PSAP callbacks.</p>
