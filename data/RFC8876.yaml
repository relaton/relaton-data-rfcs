abstract:
- content: "<p>Use of the Internet for emergency calling is described in RFC 6443,
    'Framework for Emergency Calling Using Internet Multimedia'.  In some cases of
    emergency calls, the transmission of application data is all that is needed, and
    no interactive media channel is established: a situation referred to as 'non-interactive
    emergency calls', where, unlike most emergency calls, there is no two-way interactive
    media such as voice or video or text.  This document describes use of a SIP MESSAGE
    transaction that includes a container for the data based on the Common Alerting
    Protocol (CAP).  That type of emergency request does not establish a session,
    distinguishing it from SIP INVITE, which does.  Any device that needs to initiate
    a request for emergency services without an interactive media channel would use
    the mechanisms in this document.</p>"
