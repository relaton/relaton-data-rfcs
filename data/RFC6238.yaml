abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an extension of the One-Time Password (OTP)
    algorithm, namely the HMAC-based One-Time Password (HOTP) algorithm, as defined
    in RFC 4226, to support the time-based moving factor. The HOTP algorithm specifies
    an event-based OTP algorithm, where the moving factor is an event counter. The
    present work bases the moving factor on a time value. A time-based variant of
    the OTP algorithm provides short-lived OTP values, which are desirable for enhanced
    security.</p><p>The proposed algorithm can be used across a wide range of network
    applications, from remote Virtual Private Network (VPN) access and Wi-Fi network
    logon to transaction-oriented Web applications. The authors believe that a common
    and shared algorithm will facilitate adoption of two-factor authentication on
    the Internet by enabling interoperability across commercial and open-source implementations.
    This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published
    for informational purposes.</p>"
