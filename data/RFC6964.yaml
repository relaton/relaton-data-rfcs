abstract:
- content: "<p>Many end-user sites in the Internet today still have predominantly
    IPv4 internal infrastructures.  These sites range in size from small home/office
    networks to large corporate enterprise networks, but share the commonality that
    IPv4 provides satisfactory internal routing and addressing services for most applications.
    \ As more and more IPv6-only services are deployed, however, end-user devices
    within such sites will increasingly require at least basic IPv6 functionality.
    \ This document therefore provides operational guidance for deployment of IPv6
    within predominantly IPv4 sites using the Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing
    Protocol (ISATAP).</p>"
