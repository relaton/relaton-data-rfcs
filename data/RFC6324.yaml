abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is concerned with security vulnerabilities in IPv6-in-
    IPv4 automatic tunnels.  These vulnerabilities allow an attacker to take advantage
    of inconsistencies between the IPv4 routing state and the IPv6 routing state.
    \ The attack forms a routing loop that can be abused as a vehicle for traffic
    amplification to facilitate denial- of-service (DoS) attacks.  The first aim of
    this document is to inform on this attack and its root causes.  The second aim
    is to present some possible mitigation measures.  It should be noted that at the
    time of this writing there are no known reports of malicious attacks exploiting
    these vulnerabilities.  Nonetheless, these vulnerabilities can be activated by
    accidental misconfiguration.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track
    specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
