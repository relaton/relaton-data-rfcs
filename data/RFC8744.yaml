abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes the general problem of encrypting the Server
    Name Identification (SNI) TLS parameter. The proposed solutions hide a hidden
    service behind a fronting service, only disclosing the SNI of the fronting service
    to external observers. This document lists known attacks against SNI encryption,
    discusses the current "HTTP co-tenancy" solution, and presents requirements for
    future TLS-layer solutions.</p><p>In practice, it may well be that no solution
    can meet every requirement and that practical solutions will have to make some
    compromises.</p>
