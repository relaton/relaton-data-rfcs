abstract:
- content: "<p>Some DNS recursive resolvers have longer-than-desired round-trip times
    to the closest DNS root server; those resolvers may have difficulty getting responses
    from the root servers, such as during a network attack. Some DNS recursive resolver
    operators want to prevent snooping by third parties of requests sent to DNS root
    servers. In both cases, resolvers can greatly decrease the round-trip time and
    prevent observation of requests by serving a copy of the full root zone on the
    same server, such as on a loopback address or in the resolver software. This document
    shows how to start and maintain such a copy of the root zone that does not cause
    problems for other users of the DNS, at the cost of adding some operational fragility
    for the operator.</p><p>This document obsoletes RFC 7706.</p>"
