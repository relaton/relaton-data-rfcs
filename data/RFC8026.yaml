abstract:
- content: "<p>In IPv6-only provider networks, transporting IPv4 packets encapsulated
    in IPv6 is a common solution to the problem of IPv4 service continuity.  A number
    of differing functional approaches have been developed for this, each having their
    own specific characteristics.  As these approaches share a similar functional
    architecture and use the same data plane mechanisms, this memo specifies a DHCPv6
    option, whereby a single instance of Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) can interwork
    with all of the standardized and proposed approaches to providing encapsulated
    IPv4-in-IPv6 services by providing a prioritization mechanism.</p>"
