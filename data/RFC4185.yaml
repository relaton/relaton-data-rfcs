abstract:
- content: <p>In the context of work on internationalizing the Domain Name System
    (DNS), there have been extensive discussions about "multilingual" or "internationalized"
    top level domain names (TLDs), especially for countries whose predominant language
    is not written in a Roman-based script. This document reviews some of the motivations
    for such domains, several suggestions that have been made to provide needed functionality,
    and the constraints that the DNS imposes. It then suggests an alternative, local
    translation, that may solve a superset of the problem while avoiding protocol
    changes, serious deployment delays, and other difficulties. The suggestion utilizes
    a localization technique in applications to permit any TLD to be accessed using
    the vocabulary and characters of any language. It is not restricted to language-
    or country-specific "multilingual" TLDs in the language(s) and script(s) of that
    country. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>
