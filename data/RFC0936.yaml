abstract:
- content: "<p>There have been several proposals for schemes to allow the use of a
    single Internet network number to refer to a collection of physical networks under
    common administration which are reachable from the rest of the Internet by a common
    route. Such schemes allow a simplified view of an otherwise complicated topology
    from hosts and gateways outside of this collection. They allow the complexity
    of the number and type of these networks, and routing to them, to be localized.
    Additions and changes in configuration thus cause no detectable change, and no
    interruption of service, due to slow propagation of routing and other information
    outside of the local environment. These schemes also simplify the administration
    of the network, as changes do not require allocation of new network numbers for
    each new cable installed. This proposal discusses an alternative scheme, one that
    has been in use at the University of California, Berkeley since April 1984. This
    RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the ARPA-Internet community, and requests
    discussion and suggestions for improvements.</p>"
