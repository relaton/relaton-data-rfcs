abstract:
- content: <p>A certain maximum amount of data can be safely encrypted when encryption
    is performed under a single key. This amount is called the "key lifetime". This
    specification describes a variety of methods for increasing the lifetime of symmetric
    keys. It provides two types of re-keying mechanisms based on hash functions and
    block ciphers that can be used with modes of operations such as CTR, GCM, CBC,
    CFB, and OMAC.</p><p>This document is a product of the Crypto Forum Research Group
    (CFRG) in the IRTF.</p>
