abstract:
- content: '<p>Protection and recovery are important features of service offerings
    in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks.
    Increasingly, MPLS and GMPLS networks are being extended from single domain scope
    to multi-domain environments.</p><p>Various schemes and processes have been developed
    to establish Label Switched Paths (LSPs) in multi-domain environments. These are
    discussed in RFC 4726: "A Framework for Inter-Domain Multiprotocol Label Switching
    Traffic Engineering".</p><p>This document analyzes the application of these techniques
    to protection and recovery in multi-domain networks. The main focus for this document
    is on establishing end-to-end diverse Traffic Engineering (TE) LSPs in multi-domain
    networks. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>'
