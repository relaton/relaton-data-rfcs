abstract:
- content: "<p>The standards for Internationalized Domain Names in Applications (IDNA)
    require a review of each new version of Unicode to determine whether incompatibilities
    with prior versions or other issues exist and, where appropriate, to allow the
    IETF to decide on the trade-offs between compatibility with prior IDNA versions
    and compatibility with Unicode going forward.  That requirement, and its relationship
    to tables maintained by IANA, has caused significant confusion in the past.  This
    document makes adjustments to the review procedure based on experience and updates
    IDNA, specifically RFC 5892, to reflect those changes and to clarify the various
    relationships involved.  It also makes other minor adjustments to align that document
    with experience.</p>"
