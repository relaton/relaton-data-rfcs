abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines enhancements to the Bootstrapping Remote Secure
    Key Infrastructure (BRSKI) protocol, known as BRSKI with Alternative Enrollment
    (BRSKI-AE). BRSKI-AE extends BRSKI to support certificate enrollment mechanisms
    instead of the originally specified use of Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST).
    It supports certificate enrollment protocols such as the Certificate Management
    Protocol (CMP) that use authenticated self-contained signed objects for certification
    messages, allowing for flexibility in network device onboarding scenarios. The
    enhancements address use cases where the existing enrollment mechanism may not
    be feasible or optimal, providing a framework for integrating suitable alternative
    enrollment protocols. This document also updates the BRSKI reference architecture
    to accommodate these alternative methods, ensuring secure and scalable deployment
    across a range of network environments.</p>"
