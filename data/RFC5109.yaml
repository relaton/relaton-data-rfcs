abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a payload format for generic Forward Error
    Correction (FEC) for media data encapsulated in RTP.  It is based on the exclusive-or
    (parity) operation.  The payload format described in this document allows end
    systems to apply protection using various protection lengths and levels, in addition
    to using various protection group sizes to adapt to different media and channel
    characteristics.  It enables complete recovery of the protected packets or partial
    recovery of the critical parts of the payload depending on the packet loss situation.
    \ This scheme is completely compatible with non-FEC-capable hosts, so the receivers
    in a multicast group that do not implement FEC can still work by simply ignoring
    the protection data.  This specification obsoletes RFC 2733 and RFC 3009.  The
    FEC specified in this document is not backward compatible with RFC 2733 and RFC
    3009. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
