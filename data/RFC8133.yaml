abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Security Evaluated Standardized Password-
    Authenticated Key Exchange (SESPAKE) protocol.  The SESPAKE protocol provides
    password-authenticated key exchange for usage in systems for protection of sensitive
    information.  The security proofs of the protocol were made for situations involving
    an active adversary in the channel, including man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks
    and attacks based on the impersonation of one of the subjects.</p>"
