abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines ZRTP, a protocol for media path Diffie-Hellman
    exchange to agree on a session key and parameters for establishing unicast Secure
    Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) sessions for Voice over IP (VoIP) applications.
    \ The ZRTP protocol is media path keying because it is multiplexed on the same
    port as RTP and does not require support in the signaling protocol.  ZRTP does
    not assume a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) or require the complexity of certificates
    in end devices.  For the media session, ZRTP provides confidentiality, protection
    against man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attacks, and, in cases where the signaling protocol
    provides end-to-end integrity protection, authentication.  ZRTP can utilize a
    Session Description Protocol (SDP) attribute to provide discovery and authentication
    through the signaling channel.  To provide best effort SRTP, ZRTP utilizes normal
    RTP/AVP (Audio-Visual Profile) profiles.  ZRTP secures media sessions that include
    a voice media stream and can also secure media sessions that do not include voice
    by using an optional digital signature.  This document is not an Internet Standards
    Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
