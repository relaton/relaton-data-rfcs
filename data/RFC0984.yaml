abstract:
- content: <p>This document is a preliminary discussion of the design of a personal-computer-based
    distributed mail system.  Pcmail is a distributed mail system that provides mail
    service to an arbitrary number of users, each of which owns one or more personal
    computers (PCs).  The system is divided into two halves.  The first consists of
    a single entity called the "repository".  The repository is a storage center for
    incoming mail.  Mail for a Pcmail user can arrive externally from the Internet
    or internally from other repository users.  The repository also maintains a stable
    copy of each user's mail state.  The repository is therefore typically a computer
    with a large amount of disk storage.  It is published for discussion and comment,
    and does not constitute a standard.  As the proposal may change, implementation
    of this document is not advised.  See RFC-993.</p>
