abstract:
- content: "<p>This RFC actually is a request for comments.  The issue dealt with
    is that of a naming registry update procedure, both as exists currently and what
    could exist in the future.  None of the proposed solutions are intended as standards
    at this time; rather it is hoped that a general consensus will emerge as the appropriate
    solution, leaving eventually to the adoption of standards.</p>"
