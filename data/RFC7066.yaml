abstract:
- content: "<p>As the deployment of third and fourth generation cellular networks
    progresses, a large number of cellular hosts are being connected to the Internet.
    Standardization organizations have made the Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6)
    mandatory in their specifications. However, the concept of IPv6 covers many aspects
    and numerous specifications. In addition, the characteristics of cellular links
    in terms of bandwidth, cost, and delay put special requirements on how IPv6 is
    used. This document considers IPv6 for cellular hosts that attach to the General
    Packet Radio Service (GPRS), Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS),
    or Evolved Packet System (EPS) networks (hereafter collectively referred to as
    Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) networks). This document also lists
    specific IPv6 functionalities that need to be implemented in addition to what
    is already prescribed in the IPv6 Node Requirements document (RFC 6434). It also
    discusses some issues related to the use of these components when operating in
    these networks. This document obsoletes RFC 3316.</p>"
