abstract:
- content: <p>This memo proposes an extensible Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP)
    monitoring framework for extending the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) with a new
    RTCP Extended Reports (XR) block type to report new metrics regarding media transmission
    or reception quality.  In this framework, a new XR block should contain a single
    metric or a small number of metrics relevant to a single parameter of interest
    or concern, rather than containing a number of metrics that attempt to provide
    full coverage of all those parameters of concern to a specific application.  Applications
    may then "mix and match" to create a set of blocks that cover their set of concerns.  Where
    possible, a specific block should be designed to be reusable across more than
    one application, for example, for all of voice, streaming audio, and video.  This
    document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for
    informational purposes.</p>
