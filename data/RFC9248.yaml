abstract:
- content: <p>Video Relay Service (VRS) is a term used to describe a method by which
    a hearing person can communicate with a sign language speaker who is deaf, deafblind,
    or hard of hearing (HoH) or has a speech disability using an interpreter (i.e.,
    a Communications Assistant (CA)) connected via a videophone to the sign language
    speaker and an audio telephone call to the hearing user.  The CA interprets using
    sign language on the videophone link and voice on the telephone link.  Often the
    interpreters may be employed by a company or agency, termed a "provider" in this
    document.  The provider also provides a video service that allows users to connect
    video devices to their service and subsequently to CAs and other sign language
    speakers.  It is desirable that the videophones used by the sign language speaker
    conform to a standard so that any device may be used with any provider and that
    direct video calls between sign language speakers work.  This document describes
    the interface between a videophone and a provider.</p>
