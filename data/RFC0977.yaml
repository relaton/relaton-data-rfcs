abstract:
- content: "<p>NNTP specifies a protocol for the distribution, inquiry, retrieval,
    and posting of news articles using a reliable stream-based transmission of news
    among the ARPA-Internet community. NNTP is designed so that news articles are
    stored in a central database allowing a subscriber to select only those items
    he wishes to read. Indexing, cross-referencing, and expiration of aged messages
    are also provided. This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the ARPA-Internet
    community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.</p>"
