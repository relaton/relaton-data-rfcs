abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses current mobility extensions to IP-layer multicast.
    It describes problems arising from mobile group communication in general, the
    case of multicast listener mobility, and problems for mobile senders using Any
    Source Multicast and Source-Specific Multicast. Characteristic aspects of multicast
    routing and deployment issues for fixed IPv6 networks are summarized. Specific
    properties and interplays with the underlying network access are surveyed with
    respect to the relevant technologies in the wireless domain. It outlines the principal
    approaches to multicast mobility, together with a comprehensive exploration of
    the mobile multicast problem and solution space. This document concludes with
    a conceptual road map for initial steps in standardization for use by future mobile
    multicast protocol designers. This document is a product of the IP Mobility Optimizations
    (MobOpts) Research Group. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;
    it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
