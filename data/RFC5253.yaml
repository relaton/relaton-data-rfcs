abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides an applicability statement on the use of Generalized
    Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) protocols and mechanisms to support Basic
    Mode Layer 1 Virtual Private Networks (L1VPNs).</p><p>L1VPNs provide customer
    services and connectivity at Layer 1 over Layer 1 networks. The operation of L1VPNs
    is divided into the Basic Mode and the Enhanced Mode, where the Basic Mode of
    operation does not feature any exchange of routing information between the Layer
    1 network and the customer domain. This document examines how GMPLS protocols
    can be used to satisfy the requirements of a Basic Mode L1VPN. This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.</p>"
