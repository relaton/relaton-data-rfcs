abstract:
- content: <p>This document introduces an in-band method for DNS operators to publish
    arbitrary information about the zones for which they are authoritative, in an
    authenticated fashion and on a per-zone basis. The mechanism allows managed DNS
    operators to securely announce DNSSEC key parameters for zones under their management,
    including for zones that are not currently securely delegated.</p><p>Whenever
    DS records are absent for a zone's delegation, this signal enables the parent's
    registry or registrar to cryptographically validate the CDS/CDNSKEY records found
    at the child's apex. The parent can then provision DS records for the delegation
    without resorting to out-of-band validation or weaker types of cross-checks such
    as "Accept after Delay".</p><p>This document establishes the DS enrollment method
    described in Section 4 of this document as the preferred method over those from
    Section 3 of RFC 8078. It also updates RFC 7344.</p>
