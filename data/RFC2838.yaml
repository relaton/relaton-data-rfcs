    Web browsers are starting to appear on a variety of consumer electronic devices,
    such as television sets and television set-top boxes, which are capable of receiving
    television programming from either terrestrial broadcast, satellite broadcast,

    using the URI format described in RFC 2396.  This memo provides information for
    the Internet community.</p>"
