abstract:
- content: "<p>The Network Time Protocol (NTP) allows clients to synchronize to a
    time server using timestamped protocol messages.  To facilitate accurate timestamping,
    some implementations use hardware-based timestamping engines that integrate the
    accurate transmission time into every outgoing NTP packet during transmission.
    \ Since these packets are transported over UDP, the UDP Checksum field is then
    updated to reflect this modification.  This document proposes an extension field
    that includes a 2-octet Checksum Complement, allowing timestamping engines to
    reflect the checksum modification in the last 2 octets of the packet rather than
    in the UDP Checksum field.  The behavior defined in this document is interoperable
    with existing NTP implementations.</p>"
