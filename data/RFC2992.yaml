abstract:
- content: "<p>Equal-cost multi-path (ECMP) is a routing technique for routing packets
    along multiple paths of equal cost.  The forwarding engine identifies paths by
    next-hop.  When forwarding a packet the router must decide which next-hop (path)
    to use.  This document gives an analysis of one method for making that decision.
    \ The analysis includes the performance of the algorithm and the disruption caused
    by changes to the set of next-hops.  This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.</p>"
