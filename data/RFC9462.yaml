abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines Discovery of Designated Resolvers (DDR), a set
    of mechanisms for DNS clients to use DNS records to discover a resolver's encrypted
    DNS configuration. An Encrypted DNS Resolver discovered in this manner is referred
    to as a "Designated Resolver". These mechanisms can be used to move from unencrypted
    DNS to encrypted DNS when only the IP address of a resolver is known. These mechanisms
    are designed to be limited to cases where Unencrypted DNS Resolvers and their
    Designated Resolvers are operated by the same entity or cooperating entities.
    It can also be used to discover support for encrypted DNS protocols when the name
    of an Encrypted DNS Resolver is known.</p>
