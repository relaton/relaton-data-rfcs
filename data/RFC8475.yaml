abstract:
- content: '<p>This document discusses the most common scenarios of connecting an
    enterprise network to multiple ISPs using an address space assigned by an ISP
    and how the approach proposed in "Enterprise Multihoming using Provider-Assigned
    Addresses without Network Prefix Translation: Requirements and Solution" could
    be applied in those scenarios.  The problem of enterprise multihoming without
    address translation of any form has not been solved yet as it requires both the
    network to select the correct egress ISP based on the packet source address and
    hosts to select the correct source address based on the desired egress ISP for
    that traffic.  The aforementioned document proposes a solution to this problem
    by introducing a new routing functionality (Source Address Dependent Routing)
    to solve the uplink selection issue.  It also proposes using Router Advertisements
    to influence the host source address selection.  It focuses on solving the general
    problem and covering various complex use cases, and this document adopts its proposed
    approach to provide a solution for a limited number of common use cases.  In particular,
    the focus of this document is on scenarios in which an enterprise network has
    two Internet uplinks used either in primary/backup mode or simultaneously and
    hosts in that network might not yet properly support multihoming as described
    in RFC 8028.</p>'
