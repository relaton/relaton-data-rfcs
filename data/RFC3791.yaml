abstract:
- content: "<p>This investigation work seeks to document all usage of IPv4 addresses
    in currently deployed IETF Routing Area documented standards.  In order to successfully
    transition from an all IPv4 Internet to an all IPv6 Internet, many interim steps
    will be taken.  One of these steps is the evolution of current protocols that
    have IPv4 dependencies.  It is hoped that these protocols (and their implementations)
    will be redesigned to be network address independent, but failing that will at
    least dually support IPv4 and IPv6.  To this end, all Standards (Full, Draft,
    and Proposed) as well as Experimental RFCs will be surveyed and any dependencies
    will be documented.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
