abstract:
- content: <p>This document presents some observations on "simple best-effort traffic",
    defined loosely for the purposes of this document as Internet traffic that is
    not covered by Quality of Service (QOS) mechanisms, congestion-based pricing,
    cost-based fairness, admissions control, or the like.  One observation is that
    simple best-effort traffic serves a useful role in the Internet, and is worth
    keeping.  While differential treatment of traffic can clearly be useful, we believe
    such mechanisms are useful as *adjuncts* to simple best- effort traffic, not as
    *replacements* of simple best-effort traffic.  A second observation is that for
    simple best-effort traffic, some form of rough flow-rate fairness is a useful
    goal for resource allocation, where "flow-rate fairness" is defined by the goal
    of equal flow rates for different flows over the same path.  This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.</p>
