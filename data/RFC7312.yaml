abstract:
- content: "<p>To obtain repeatable results in modern networks, test descriptions
    need an expanded stream parameter framework that also augments aspects specified
    as Type-P for test packets.  This memo updates the IP Performance Metrics (IPPM)
    Framework, RFC 2330, with advanced considerations for measurement methodology
    and testing.  The existing framework mostly assumes deterministic connectivity,
    and that a single test stream will represent the characteristics of the path when
    it is aggregated with other flows.  Networks have evolved and test stream descriptions
    must evolve with them; otherwise, unexpected network features may dominate the
    measured performance.  This memo describes new stream parameters for both network
    characterization and support of application design using IPPM metrics.</p>"
