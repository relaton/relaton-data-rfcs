abstract:
- content: <p>Multiprotocol Label Switching Traffic Engineered (MPLS TE) Label Switched
    Paths (LSPs) may be established wholly within an Autonomous System (AS) or may
    cross AS boundaries.</p><p>The Path Computation Element (PCE) is a component that
    is capable of computing constrained paths for (G)MPLS TE LSPs. The PCE Communication
    Protocol (PCECP) is defined to allow communication between Path Computation Clients
    (PCCs) and PCEs, as well as between PCEs. The PCECP is used to request constrained
    paths and to supply computed paths in response. Generic requirements for the PCECP
    are set out in "Path Computation Element (PCE) Communication Protocol Generic
    Requirements", RFC 4657. This document extends those requirements to cover the
    use of PCECP in support of inter-AS MPLS TE. This memo provides information for
    the Internet community.</p>
