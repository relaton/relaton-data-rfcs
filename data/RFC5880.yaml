abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a protocol intended to detect faults in the
    bidirectional path between two forwarding engines, including interfaces, data
    link(s), and to the extent possible the forwarding engines themselves, with potentially
    very low latency.  It operates independently of media, data protocols, and routing
    protocols. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
