abstract:
- content: <p>The main goal of the networking standards process is to enable the long-term
    interoperability of protocols. This document describes active protocol maintenance,
    a means to accomplish that goal. By evolving specifications and implementations,
    it is possible to reduce ambiguity over time and create a healthy ecosystem.</p><p>The
    robustness principle, often phrased as "be conservative in what you send, and
    liberal in what you accept", has long guided the design and implementation of
    Internet protocols. However, it has been interpreted in a variety of ways. While
    some interpretations help ensure the health of the Internet, others can negatively
    affect interoperability over time. When a protocol is actively maintained, protocol
    designers and implementers can avoid these pitfalls.</p>
