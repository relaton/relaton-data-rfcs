abstract:
- content: <p>The SIP "Caller Preferences" extension defined in RFC 3840 provides
    a mechanism that allows a SIP request to convey information relating to the originator's
    capabilities and preferences for handling of that request.  The SIP REFER method
    defined in RFC 3515 provides a mechanism that allows one party to induce another
    to initiate a SIP request.  This document extends the REFER method to use the
    mechanism of RFC 3840.  By doing so, the originator of a REFER may inform the
    recipient as to the characteristics of the target that the induced request is
    expected to reach. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
