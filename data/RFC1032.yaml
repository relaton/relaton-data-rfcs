abstract:
- content: "<p>Domains are administrative entities that provide decentralized management
    of host naming and addressing.  The domain-naming system is distributed and hierarchical.
    \ This memo describes procedures for registering a domain with the Network Information
    Center (NIC) of Defense Data Network (DDN), and offers guidelines on the establishment
    and administration of a domain in accordance with the requirements specified in
    RFC-920.  It is recommended that the guidelines described in this document be
    used by domain administrators in the establishment and control of second-level
    domains.  The role of the domain administrator (DA) is that of coordinator, manager,
    and technician.  If his domain is established at the second level or lower in
    the tree, the domain administrator must register by interacting with the management
    of the domain directly above this.</p>"
