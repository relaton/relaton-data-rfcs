abstract:
- content: <p>In Proxy Mobile IPv6, packets received from a Mobile Node (MN) by the
    Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) to which it is attached are typically tunneled to
    a Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) for routing. The term "localized routing" refers
    to a method by which packets are routed directly between an MN's MAG and the MAG
    of its Correspondent Node (CN) without involving any LMA. In a Proxy Mobile IPv6
    deployment, it may be desirable to control the establishment of localized routing
    sessions between two MAGs in a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain by requiring that the
    session be authorized. This document specifies how to accomplish this using the
    Diameter protocol.</p>
