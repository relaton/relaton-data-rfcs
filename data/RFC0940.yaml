abstract:
- content: "<p>Several sites now contain a complex of local links connected to the
    Internet via a gateway.  The details of the internal connectivity are of little
    interest to the rest of the Internet.  One way of organizing these local complexes
    of links is to use the same strategy as the Internet uses to organize networks,
    that is, to declare each link to be an entity (like a network) and to interconnect
    the links with devices that perform routing functions (like gateways).  This general
    scheme is called subnetting, the individual links are called subnets, and the
    connecting devices are called subgateways (or bridges, or gateways).  This RFC
    discusses standardizing the protocol used in subnetted environments in the ARPA-Internet.</p>"
