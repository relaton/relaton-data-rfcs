abstract:
- content: "<p>This Network Working Group Request for Comments documents the currently
    assigned values from several series of numbers used in network protocol implementations.
    \ This RFC will be updated periodically, and in any case current information can
    be obtained from Joyce Reynolds.  The assignment of numbers is also handled by
    Joyce.  If you are developing a protocol or application that will require the
    use of a link, socket, port, protocol, network number, etc., please contact Joyce
    to receive a number assignment.  This memo is an official status report on the
    numbers used in protocols in the ARPA-Internet community.  See RFC-990 and 997.</p>"
