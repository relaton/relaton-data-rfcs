abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes a collection of mechanisms that allow HTTP servers
    to cryptographically bind security tokens (such as cookies and OAuth tokens) to
    TLS connections.</p><p>We describe both first-party and federated scenarios. In
    a first- party scenario, an HTTP server is able to cryptographically bind the
    security tokens that it issues to a client -- and that the client subsequently
    returns to the server -- to the TLS connection between the client and the server.
    Such bound security tokens are protected from misuse, since the server can generally
    detect if they are replayed inappropriately, e.g., over other TLS connections.</p><p>Federated
    Token Bindings, on the other hand, allow servers to cryptographically bind security
    tokens to a TLS connection that the client has with a different server than the
    one issuing the token.</p><p>This document is a companion document to "The Token
    Binding Protocol Version 1.0" (RFC 8471).</p>
