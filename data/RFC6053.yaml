abstract:
- content: "<p>Forwarding and Control Element Separation (ForCES) defines an architectural
    framework and associated protocols to standardize information exchange between
    the control plane and the forwarding plane in a ForCES network element (ForCES
    NE). RFC 3654 has defined the ForCES requirements, and RFC 3746 has defined the
    ForCES framework.</p><p>This document is an implementation report for the ForCES
    Protocol, Model, and the Stream Control Transmission Protocol-based Transport
    Mapping Layer (SCTP TML) documents, and includes a report on interoperability
    testing and the current state of ForCES implementations. This document is not
    an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
