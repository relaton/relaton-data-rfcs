abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes the results gathered from testing NETBLT over three
    networks of different bandwidths and round-trip delays.  The results are not complete,
    but the information gathered so far has not been promising.  The NETBLT protocol
    is specified in RFC-998; this document assumes an understanding of the specification
    as described in RFC-998.</p>"
