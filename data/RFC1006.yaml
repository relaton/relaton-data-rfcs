abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo specifies a standard for the Internet community.  Hosts on
    the Internet that choose to implement ISO transport services on top of the TCP
    are expected to adopt and implement this standard.  TCP port 102 is reserved for
    hosts which implement this standard.  This memo specifies version 3 of the protocol
    and supersedes RFC-983.  Changes between the protocol is described in RFC-983
    and this memo are minor, but unfortunately incompatible.</p>"
