abstract:
- content: "<p>The original registration procedure for formal Uniform Resource Name
    (URN) namespaces required IETF Consensus.  That requirement discouraged some registrations
    and increased the risk for problems that could occur as a result.  The requirements
    have now been changed by RFC 8141, which adopts a different model, focusing on
    encouraging registration and publication of information for all appropriate namespaces.
    \ This document clarifies the status of relevant older RFCs and confirms and documents
    advice to IANA about selected existing registrations.  This document also obsoletes
    RFCs 3044 and 3187 and moves them to Historic status.  These RFCs describe the
    ISSN and ISBN namespaces, which are now outdated because the descriptions reside
    in registration templates.</p>"
