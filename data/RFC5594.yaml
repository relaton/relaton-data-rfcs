abstract:
- content: "<p>This document reports the outcome of a workshop organized by the Real-time
    Applications and Infrastructure Area Directors of the IETF to discuss network
    delay and congestion issues resulting from increased Peer-to-Peer (P2P) traffic
    volumes. The workshop was held on May 28, 2008 at MIT in Cambridge, MA, USA. The
    goals of the workshop were twofold: to understand the technical problems that
    ISPs and end users are experiencing as a result of high volumes of P2P traffic,
    and to begin to understand how the IETF may be helpful in addressing these problems.
    Gaining an understanding of where in the IETF this work might be pursued and how
    to extract feasible work items were highlighted as important tasks in pursuit
    of the latter goal. The workshop was very well attended and produced several work
    items that have since been taken up by members of the IETF community. This memo
    provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
