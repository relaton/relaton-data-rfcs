abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines a new disposition type (early-session) for the
    Content-Disposition header field in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).  The
    treatment of "early-session" bodies is similar to the treatment of "session" bodies.  That
    is, they follow the offer/answer model.  Their only difference is that session
    descriptions whose disposition type is "early-session" are used to establish early
    media sessions within early dialogs, as opposed to regular sessions within regular
    dialogs. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
