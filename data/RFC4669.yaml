abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines a set of extensions that instrument RADIUS authentication
    server functions. These extensions represent a portion of the Management Information
    Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
    Using these extensions, IP-based management stations can manage RADIUS authentication
    servers.</p><p>This memo obsoletes RFC 2619 by deprecating the MIB table containing
    IPv4-only address formats and defining a new table to add support for version-neutral
    IP address formats. The remaining MIB objects from RFC 2619 are carried forward
    into this document. This memo also adds UNITS and REFERENCE clauses to selected
    objects. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
