abstract:
- content: "<p>DNS error reporting is a lightweight reporting mechanism that provides
    the operator of an authoritative server with reports on DNS resource records that
    fail to resolve or validate. A domain owner or DNS hosting organization can use
    these reports to improve domain hosting. The reports are based on extended DNS
    errors as described in RFC 8914.</p><p>When a domain name fails to resolve or
    validate due to a misconfiguration or an attack, the operator of the authoritative
    server may be unaware of this. To mitigate this lack of feedback, this document
    describes a method for a validating resolver to automatically signal an error
    to a monitoring agent specified by the authoritative server. The error is encoded
    in the QNAME; thus, the very act of sending the query is to report the error.</p>"
