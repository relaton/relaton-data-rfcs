abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the architecture of the eduroam service for
    federated (wireless) network access in academia.  The combination of IEEE 802.1X,
    the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), and RADIUS that is used in eduroam
    provides a secure, scalable, and deployable service for roaming network access.
    \ The successful deployment of eduroam over the last decade in the educational
    sector may serve as an example for other sectors, hence this document.  In particular,
    the initial architectural choices and selection of standards are described, along
    with the changes that were prompted by operational experience.</p>"
