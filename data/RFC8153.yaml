abstract:
- content: "<p>The RFC Editor is both the publisher and the archivist for the RFC
    Series.  This document applies specifically to the archivist role of the RFC Editor.
    \ It provides guidance on when and how to preserve RFCs and describes the tools
    required to view or re-create RFCs as necessary.  This document also highlights
    gaps in the current process and suggests compromises to balance cost with best
    practice.</p>"
