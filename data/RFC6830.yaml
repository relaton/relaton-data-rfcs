abstract:
- content: '<p>This document describes a network-layer-based protocol that enables
    separation of IP addresses into two new numbering spaces: Endpoint Identifiers
    (EIDs) and Routing Locators (RLOCs). No changes are required to either host protocol
    stacks or to the "core" of the Internet infrastructure. The Locator/ID Separation
    Protocol (LISP) can be incrementally deployed, without a "flag day", and offers
    Traffic Engineering, multihoming, and mobility benefits to early adopters, even
    when there are relatively few LISP-capable sites.</p><p>Design and development
    of LISP was largely motivated by the problem statement produced by the October
    2006 IAB Routing and Addressing Workshop. This document defines an Experimental
    Protocol for the Internet community.</p>'
