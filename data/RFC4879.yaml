abstract:
- content: "<p>This document clarifies and updates a single sentence in RFC 3979.
    Specifically, when third party Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) disclosures
    are made, the intention is that the IETF Executive Director notify the IPR holder
    that a third party disclosure has been filed, and to ask the IPR holder whether
    they have any disclosure that needs to be made, per applicable RFC 3979 rules.
    This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community,
    and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.</p>"
