abstract:
- content: <p>A "Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode" Join message sent by
    a given node identifies one or more multicast distribution trees that that node
    wishes to join.  Each tree is identified by the combination of a multicast group
    address and a source address (where the source address is possibly a "wild card").  Under
    certain conditions it can be useful, when joining a tree, to specify additional
    information related to the construction of the tree.  However, there has been
    no way to do so until now.  This document describes a modification of the Join
    message that allows a node to associate attributes with a particular tree.  The
    attributes are encoded in Type-Length-Value format. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
