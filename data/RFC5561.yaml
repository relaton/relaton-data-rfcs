abstract:
- content: "<p>A number of enhancements to the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) have
    been proposed.  Some have been implemented, and some are advancing toward standardization.
    \ It is likely that additional enhancements will be proposed in the future.  This
    document defines a mechanism for advertising LDP enhancements at session initialization
    time, as well as a mechanism to enable and disable enhancements after LDP session
    establishment. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
