abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC) format and
    its streamable subset. FLAC is designed to reduce the amount of computer storage
    space needed to store digital audio signals. It does this losslessly, i.e., it
    does so without losing information. FLAC is free in the sense that its specification
    is open and its reference implementation is open source. Compared to other lossless
    audio coding formats, FLAC is a format with low complexity and can be encoded
    and decoded with little computing resources. Decoding of FLAC has been implemented
    independently for many different platforms, and both encoding and decoding can
    be implemented without needing floating-point arithmetic.</p>"
