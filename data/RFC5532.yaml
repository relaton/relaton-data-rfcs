abstract:
- content: "<p>This document addresses enabling the use of Remote Direct Memory Access
    (RDMA) by the Network File System (NFS) protocols.  NFS implementations historically
    incur significant overhead due to data copies on end-host systems, as well as
    other processing overhead.  This document explores the potential benefits of RDMA
    to these implementations and evaluates the reasons why RDMA is especially well-suited
    to NFS and network file protocols in general.  This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.</p>"
