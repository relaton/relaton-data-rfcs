abstract:
- content: "<p>TCP/IP communication is currently restricted to a single path per connection,
    yet multiple paths often exist between peers. The simultaneous use of these multiple
    paths for a TCP/IP session would improve resource usage within the network and,
    thus, improve user experience through higher throughput and improved resilience
    to network failure.</p><p>Multipath TCP provides the ability to simultaneously
    use multiple paths between peers. This document presents a set of extensions to
    traditional TCP to support multipath operation. The protocol offers the same type
    of service to applications as TCP (i.e., reliable bytestream), and it provides
    the components necessary to establish and use multiple TCP flows across potentially
    disjoint paths. This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet
    community.</p>"
