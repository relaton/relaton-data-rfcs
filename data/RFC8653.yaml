abstract:
- content: "<p>Applications differ with respect to whether they need session continuity
    and/or IP address reachability.  The network providing the same type of service
    to any mobile host and any application running on the host yields inefficiencies,
    as described in RFC 7333.  This document defines a new concept of enabling applications
    to influence the network's mobility services (session continuity and/or IP address
    reachability) on a per-socket basis, and suggests extensions to the networking
    stack's API to accommodate this concept.</p>"
