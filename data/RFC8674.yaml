abstract:
- content: <p>This specification defines a preference for HTTP requests that expresses
    a desire to avoid objectionable content, according to the definition of that term
    by the origin server.</p><p>This specification does not define a precise semantic
    for "safe". Rather, the term is interpreted by the server and within the scope
    of each web site that chooses to act upon this information.</p><p>Support for
    this preference by clients and servers is optional.</p>
