abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the link selection sub-option of the relay-
    agent-information option for the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCPv4).
    \ The giaddr specifies an IP address which determines both a subnet, and thereby
    a link on which a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) client resides as
    well as an IP address that can be used to communicate with the relay agent.  The
    subnet-selection option allows the functions of the giaddr to be split so that
    when one entity is performing as a DHCP proxy, it can specify the subnet/link
    from which to allocate an IP address, which is different from the IP address with
    which it desires to communicate with the DHCP server.  Analogous situations exist
    where the relay agent needs to specify the subnet/link on which a DHCP client
    resides, which is different from an IP address that can be used to communicate
    with the relay agent. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
