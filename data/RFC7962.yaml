abstract:
- content: <p>This document presents a taxonomy of a set of "Alternative Network Deployments"
    that emerged in the last decade with the aim of bringing Internet connectivity
    to people or providing a local communication infrastructure to serve various complementary
    needs and objectives. They employ architectures and topologies different from
    those of mainstream networks and rely on alternative governance and business models.</p><p>The
    document also surveys the technologies deployed in these networks, and their differing
    architectural characteristics, including a set of definitions and shared properties.</p><p>The
    classification considers models such as Community Networks, Wireless Internet
    Service Providers (WISPs), networks owned by individuals but leased out to network
    operators who use them as a low-cost medium to reach the underserved population,
    networks that provide connectivity by sharing wireless resources of the users,
    and rural utility cooperatives.</p>
