abstract:
- content: "<p>For scalability purposes, multiple data links can be combined to form
    a single traffic engineering (TE) link.  Furthermore, the management of TE links
    is not restricted to in-band messaging, but instead can be done using out-of-band
    techniques.  This document specifies a link management protocol (LMP) that runs
    between a pair of nodes and is used to manage TE links.  Specifically, LMP will
    be used to maintain control channel connectivity, verify the physical connectivity
    of the data links, correlate the link property information, suppress downstream
    alarms, and localize link failures for protection/restoration purposes in multiple
    kinds of networks. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
