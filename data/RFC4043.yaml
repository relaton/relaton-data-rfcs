abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a new form of name, called permanent identifier,
    that may be included in the subjectAltName extension of a public key certificate
    issued to an entity.</p><p>The permanent identifier is an optional feature that
    may be used by a CA to indicate that two or more certificates relate to the same
    entity, even if they contain different subject name (DNs) or different names in
    the subjectAltName extension, or if the name or the affiliation of that entity
    stored in the subject or another name form in the subjectAltName extension has
    changed.</p><p>The subject name, carried in the subject field, is only unique
    for each subject entity certified by the one CA as defined by the issuer name
    field. However, the new name form can carry a name that is unique for each subject
    entity certified by a CA. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
