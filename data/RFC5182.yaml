abstract:
- content: "<p>Many IMAP clients use the result of a SEARCH command as the input to
    perform another operation, for example, fetching the found messages, deleting
    them, or copying them to another mailbox.</p><p>This can be achieved using standard
    IMAP operations described in RFC 3501; however, this would be suboptimal. The
    server will send the list of found messages to the client; after that, the client
    will have to parse the list, reformat it, and send it back to the server. The
    client can't pipeline the SEARCH command with the subsequent command, and, as
    a result, the server might not be able to perform some optimizations.</p><p>This
    document proposes an IMAP extension that allows a client to tell a server to use
    the result of a SEARCH (or Unique Identifier (UID) SEARCH) command as an input
    to any subsequent command. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
