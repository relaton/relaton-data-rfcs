abstract:
- content: "<p>Each Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) router in
    a PIM domain that supports Any Source Multicast (ASM) maintains Group-to-RP mappings
    that are used to identify a Rendezvous Point (RP) for a specific multicast group.
    PIM-SM has defined an algorithm to choose a RP from the Group-to-RP mappings learned
    using various mechanisms. This algorithm does not consider the PIM mode and the
    mechanism through which a Group-to-RP mapping was learned.</p><p>This document
    defines a standard algorithm to deterministically choose between several Group-to-RP
    mappings for a specific group. This document first explains the requirements to
    extend the Group-to-RP mapping algorithm and then proposes the new algorithm.
