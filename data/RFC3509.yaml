abstract:
- content: "<p>Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is a link-state intra-domain routing
    protocol used for routing in IP networks.  Though the definition of the Area Border
    Router (ABR) in the OSPF specification does not require a router with multiple
    attached areas to have a backbone connection, it is actually necessary to provide
    successful routing to the inter-area and external destinations.  If this requirement
    is not met, all traffic destined for the areas not connected to such an ABR or
    out of the OSPF domain, is dropped.  This document describes alternative ABR behaviors
    implemented in Cisco and IBM routers.  This memo provides information for the
    Internet community.</p>"
