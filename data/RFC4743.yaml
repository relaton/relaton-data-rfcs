abstract:
- content: "<p>The Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) is applicable to a wide
    range of devices in a variety of environments.  Web Services is one such environment
    and is presently characterized by the use of the Simple Object Access Protocol
    (SOAP).  NETCONF finds many benefits in this environment: from the reuse of existing
    standards, to ease of software development, to integration with deployed systems.
    \ Herein, we describe SOAP over HTTP and SOAP over Blocks Exchange Extensible
    Protocol (BEEP) bindings for NETCONF. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
