abstract:
- content: "<p>The Real-time Transport Object delivery over Unidirectional Transport
    (ROUTE) protocol is specified for robust delivery of Application Objects, including
    Application Objects with real-time delivery constraints, to receivers over a unidirectional
    transport. Application Objects consist of data that has meaning to applications
    that use the ROUTE protocol for delivery of data to receivers; for example, it
    can be a file, a Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) or HTTP Live Streaming
    (HLS) segment, a WAV audio clip, etc. The ROUTE protocol also supports low-latency
    streaming applications.</p><p>The ROUTE protocol is suitable for unicast, broadcast,
    and multicast transport. Therefore, it can be run over UDP/IP, including multicast
    IP. The ROUTE protocol can leverage the features of the underlying protocol layer,
    e.g., to provide security, it can leverage IP security protocols such as IPsec.</p><p>This
    document specifies the ROUTE protocol such that it could be used by a variety
    of services for delivery of Application Objects by specifying their own profiles
    of this protocol (e.g., by adding or constraining some features).</p><p>This is
    not an IETF specification and does not have IETF consensus.</p>"
