abstract:
- content: "<p>The Request Routing interface comprises (1) the asynchronous advertisement
    of footprint and capabilities by a downstream Content Delivery Network (CDN) that
    allows an upstream CDN to decide whether to redirect particular user requests
    to that downstream CDN; and (2) the synchronous operation of an upstream CDN requesting
    whether a downstream CDN is prepared to accept a user request and of a downstream
    CDN responding with how to actually redirect the user request.  This document
    describes an interface for the latter part, i.e., the CDNI Request Routing Redirection
    interface.</p>"
