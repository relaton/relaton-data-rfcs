abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a real-time transport protocol (RTP) payload
    format to be used for the Variable-Rate Multimode Wideband (VMR-WB) speech codec.
    The payload format is designed to be able to interoperate with existing VMR-WB
    transport formats on non-IP networks. A media type registration is included for
    VMR-WB RTP payload format.</p><p>VMR-WB is a variable-rate multimode wideband
    speech codec that has a number of operating modes, one of which is interoperable
    with AMR-WB (i.e., RFC 3267) audio codec at certain rates. Therefore, provisions
    have been made in this document to facilitate and simplify data packet exchange
    between VMR-WB and AMR-WB in the interoperable mode with no transcoding function
    involved. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
