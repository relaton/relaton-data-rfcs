abstract:
- content: "<p>This document explores the issues involved in the use of edge computing
    resources to operationalize a media use case that involves an Extended Reality
    (XR) application. In particular, this document discusses an XR application that
    can run on devices having different form factors (such as different physical sizes
    and shapes) and needs edge computing resources to mitigate the effect of problems
    such as the need to support interactive communication requiring low latency, limited
    battery power, and heat dissipation from those devices. This document also discusses
    the expected behavior of XR applications, which can be used to manage traffic,
    and the service requirements for XR applications to be able to run on the network.
    Network operators who are interested in providing edge computing resources to
    operationalize the requirements of such applications are the intended audience
    for this document.</p>"
