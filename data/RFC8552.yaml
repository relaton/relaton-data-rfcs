abstract:
- content: <p>Formally, any DNS Resource Record (RR) may occur under any domain name.  However,
    some services use an operational convention for defining specific interpretations
    of an RRset by locating the records in a DNS branch under the parent domain to
    which the RRset actually applies.  The top of this subordinate branch is defined
    by a naming convention that uses a reserved node name, which begins with the underscore
    character (e.g., "_name").  The underscored naming construct defines a semantic
    scope for DNS record types that are associated with the parent domain above the
    underscored branch.  This specification explores the nature of this DNS usage
    and defines the "Underscored and Globally Scoped DNS Node Names" registry with
    IANA.  The purpose of this registry is to avoid collisions resulting from the
    use of the same underscored name for different services.</p>
