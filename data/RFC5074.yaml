abstract:
- content: "<p>DNSSEC Lookaside Validation (DLV) is a mechanism for publishing DNS
    Security (DNSSEC) trust anchors outside of the DNS delegation chain.  It allows
    validating resolvers to validate DNSSEC-signed data from zones whose ancestors
    either aren't signed or don't publish Delegation Signer (DS) records for their
    children.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
