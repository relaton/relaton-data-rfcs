abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 5247 is updated to define and clarify EAP Session-Id derivation
    for multiple Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) methods.  The derivation
    of Session-Id was not given for EAP Subscriber Identity Module (EAP-SIM) or EAP
    Authentication and Key Agreement (EAP-AKA) when using the fast reconnect exchange
    instead of full authentication.  The derivation of Session-Id for full authentication
    is clarified for both EAP-SIM and EAP-AKA.  The derivation of Session-Id for Protected
    EAP (PEAP) is also given.  The definition for PEAP follows the definition for
    other TLS-based EAP methods.</p>"
