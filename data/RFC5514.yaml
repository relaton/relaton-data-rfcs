abstract:
- content: "<p>There is a lack of IPv6 utilization in early 2009; this is partly linked
    to the fact that the number of IPv6 nodes is rather low.  This document proposes
    to vastly increase the number of IPv6 hosts by transforming all Social Networking
    platforms into IPv6 networks.  This will immediately add millions of IPv6 hosts
    to the existing IPv6 Internet.  This document includes sections on addressing
    and transport of IPv6 over a Social Network.  A working prototype has been developed.
    \ This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</p>"
