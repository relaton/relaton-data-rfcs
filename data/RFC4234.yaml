abstract:
- content: "<p>Internet technical specifications often need to define a formal syntax.
    \ Over the years, a modified version of Backus-Naur Form (BNF), called Augmented
    BNF (ABNF), has been popular among many Internet specifications.  The current
    specification documents ABNF.  It balances compactness and simplicity, with reasonable
    representational power.  The differences between standard BNF and ABNF involve
    naming rules, repetition, alternatives, order-independence, and value ranges.
    \ This specification also supplies additional rule definitions and encoding for
    a core lexical analyzer of the type common to several Internet specifications.
