abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a method that allows a Message Originator to
    specify a Complaint Feedback Loop (CFBL) address as a message header field. It
    also defines the rules for processing and forwarding such a complaint. The motivation
    for this arises out of the absence of a standardized and automated way to provide
    Mailbox Providers with an address for a CFBL. Currently, providing and maintaining
    such an address is a manual and time-consuming process for Message Originators
    and Mailbox Providers.</p><p>The mechanism specified in this document is being
    published as an experiment to gather feedback and gauge the interest of implementers
    and deployers. This document is produced through the Independent RFC Stream and
    was not subject to the IETF's approval process.</p>"
