abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the conventions for using the Walnut Digital
    Signature Algorithm (WalnutDSA) for digital signatures with the CBOR Object Signing
    and Encryption (COSE) syntax. WalnutDSA is a lightweight, quantum-resistant signature
    scheme based on Group Theoretic Cryptography with implementation and computational
    efficiency of signature verification in constrained environments, even on 8- and
    16-bit platforms.</p><p>The goal of this publication is to document a way to use
    the lightweight, quantum-resistant WalnutDSA signature algorithm in COSE in a
    way that would allow multiple developers to build compatible implementations.
    As of this publication, the security properties of WalnutDSA have not been evaluated
    by the IETF and its use has not been endorsed by the IETF.</p><p>WalnutDSA and
    the Walnut Digital Signature Algorithm are trademarks of Veridify Security Inc.</p>"
