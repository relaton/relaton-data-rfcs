abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo updates the ODETTE File Transfer Protocol, an established
    file transfer protocol facilitating electronic data interchange of business data
    between trading partners, to version 2.</p><p>The protocol now supports secure
    and authenticated communication over the Internet using Transport Layer Security,
    provides file encryption, signing, and compression using Cryptographic Message
    Syntax, and provides signed receipts for the acknowledgement of received files.</p><p>The
    protocol supports both direct peer-to-peer communication and indirect communication
    via a Value Added Network and may be used with TCP/IP, X.25, and ISDN-based networks.
    This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
