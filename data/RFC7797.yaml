abstract:
- content: "<p>JSON Web Signature (JWS) represents the payload of a JWS as a base64url-encoded
    value and uses this value in the JWS Signature computation. While this enables
    arbitrary payloads to be integrity protected, some have described use cases in
    which the base64url encoding is unnecessary and/or an impediment to adoption,
    especially when the payload is large and/or detached. This specification defines
    a means of accommodating these use cases by defining an option to change the JWS
    Signing Input computation to not base64url- encode the payload. This option is
    intended to broaden the set of use cases for which the use of JWS is a good fit.</p><p>This
    specification updates RFC 7519 by stating that JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) MUST NOT
    use the unencoded payload option defined by this specification.</p>"
