abstract:
- content: "<p>The CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) message structure uses
    references to keys in general.  For some algorithms, additional properties are
    defined that carry parameters relating to keys as needed.  The COSE Key structure
    is used for transporting keys outside of COSE messages.  This document extends
    the way that keys can be identified and transported by providing attributes that
    refer to or contain X.509 certificates.</p>"
