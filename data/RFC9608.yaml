abstract:
- content: "<p>X.509v3 public key certificates are profiled in RFC 5280. Short-lived
    certificates are seeing greater use in the Internet. The Certification Authority
    (CA) that issues these short-lived certificates do not publish revocation information
    because the certificate lifespan that is shorter than the time needed to detect,
    report, and distribute revocation information. Some long-lived X.509v3 public
    key certificates never expire, and they are never revoked. This specification
    defines the noRevAvail certificate extension so that a relying party can readily
    determine that the CA does not publish revocation information for the certificate,
    and it updates the certification path validation algorithm defined in RFC 5280
    so that revocation checking is skipped when the noRevAvail certificate extension
    is present.</p>"
