abstract:
- content: "<p>This document has been reviewed by the Federal Engineering Task Force
    (FEPG) on behalf of the Federal Networking Council (FNC), the co-chairs of the
    International Engineering Planning Group (IEPG), and the Reseaux IP Europeens
    (RIPE).  There was general consensus by those groups to support the recommendations
    proposed in this document for management of the IP address space.  This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.  It does not specify an Internet standard.
    \ This RFC suggests an extension to the IP protocol to solve the shortage of IP
    address problem, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.  This
    memo provides information for the Internet community.  It does not specify an
    Internet standard.  This memo defines the various criteria to be used when designing
    Autonomous System Border Routers (ASBR) that will run BGP with other ASBRs external
    to the AS and OSPF as its IGP. [STANDARDS-TRACK] 1363 Partridge Spt 92 A Proposed
    Flow Specification The flow specification defined in this memo is intended for
    information and possible experimentation (i.e., experimental use by consenting
    routers and applications only).  This RFC is a product of the Internet Research
    Task Force (IRTF).  This memo provides information for the Internet community.
    \ It does not specify an Internet standard.</p>"
