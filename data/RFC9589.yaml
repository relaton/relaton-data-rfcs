abstract:
- content: "<p>In the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI), Signed Objects are
    defined as Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) protected content types. A Signed
    Object contains a signing-time attribute, representing the purported time at which
    the object was signed by its issuer. RPKI repositories are accessible using the
    rsync and RPKI Repository Delta protocols, allowing Relying Parties (RPs) to synchronize
    a local copy of the RPKI repository used for validation with the remote repositories.
    This document describes how the CMS signing-time attribute can be used to avoid
    needless retransfers of data when switching between different synchronization
    protocols. This document updates RFC 6488 by mandating the presence of the CMS
    signing-time attribute and disallowing the use of the binary-signing-time attribute.</p>"
