abstract:
- content: "<p>Sliding window protocols use finite sequence numbers to determine segment
    placement and order.  These sequence number spaces wrap around and are reused
    during the operation of such protocols.  This document describes a way to extend
    the size of these sequence numbers at the endpoints to avoid the impact of that
    wrap and reuse without transmitting additional information in the packet header.
    \ The resulting extended sequence numbers can be used at the endpoints in encryption
    and authentication algorithms to ensure input bit patterns do not repeat over
    the lifetime of a connection.</p>"
