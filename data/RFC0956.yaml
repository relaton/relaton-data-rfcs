abstract:
- content: "<p>This RFC discussed clock synchronization algorithms for the ARPA-Internet
    community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.  The recent
    interest within the Internet community in determining accurate time from a set
    of mutually suspicious network clocks has been prompted by several occasions in
    which errors were found in usually reliable, accurate clock servers after thunderstorms
    which disrupted their power supply.  To these sources of error should be added
    those due to malfunctioning hardware, defective software and operator mistakes,
    as well as random errors in the mechanism used to set and synchronize clocks.
    \ This report suggests a stochastic model and algorithms for computing a good
    estimator from time-offset samples measured between clocks connected via network
    links.  Included in this report are descriptions of certain experiments which
    give an indication of the effectiveness of the algorithms.</p>"
