abstract:
- content: "<p>The Domain Name System (DNS) was designed to return matching records
    efficiently for queries for data that are relatively static.  When those records
    change frequently, DNS is still efficient at returning the updated results when
    polled, as long as the polling rate is not too high.  But, there exists no mechanism
    for a client to be asynchronously notified when these changes occur.  This document
    defines a mechanism for a client to be notified of such changes to DNS records,
    called DNS Push Notifications.</p>"
