abstract:
- content: "<p>The X.400 series protocols have been defined by CCITT to provide an
    Interpersonal Messaging Service (IPMS), making use of a store and forward Message
    Transfer Service.  It is expected that this standard will be implemented very
    widely.  This document describes a set of mappings which will enable interworking
    between systems operating the X.400 protocols and systems using RFC-822 mail protocol
    or protocols derived from RFC-822.  This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for
    the ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.</p>"
