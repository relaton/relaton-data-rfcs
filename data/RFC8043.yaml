abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents the source-address-dependent routing (SADR)
    problem space from the host's perspective. Both multihomed hosts and hosts with
    multiple interfaces are considered. Several network architectures are presented
    to illustrate why source address selection and next-hop resolution are needed
    in view of source-address-dependent routing.</p><p>The document is scoped on identifying
    a set of scenarios for source-address-dependent routing from the host's perspective
    and analyzing a set of solutions to mitigate encountered issues. The document
    does not make any solution recommendations.</p>"
