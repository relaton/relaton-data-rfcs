abstract:
- content: "<p>The migration from Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering
    (TE) to Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) is the process of evolving an MPLS-TE control
    plane to a GMPLS control plane. An appropriate migration strategy will be selected
    based on various factors including the service provider's network deployment plan,
    customer demand, and operational policy.</p><p>This document presents several
    migration models and strategies for migrating from MPLS-TE to GMPLS. In the course
    of migration, MPLS-TE and GMPLS devices, or networks, may coexist that may require
    interworking between MPLS-TE and GMPLS protocols. Aspects of the required interworking
    are discussed as it will influence the choice of a migration strategy. This framework
    document provides a migration toolkit to aid the operator in selection of an appropriate
    strategy.</p><p>This framework document also lists a set of solutions that may
    aid in interworking, and highlights a set of potential issues. This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.</p>"
