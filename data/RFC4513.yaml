abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes authentication methods and security mechanisms
    of the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). This document details establishment
    of Transport Layer Security (TLS) using the StartTLS operation.</p><p>This document
    details the simple Bind authentication method including anonymous, unauthenticated,
    and name/password mechanisms and the Simple Authentication and Security Layer
    (SASL) Bind authentication method including the EXTERNAL mechanism.</p><p>This
    document discusses various authentication and authorization states through which
    a session to an LDAP server may pass and the actions that trigger these state
    changes.</p><p>This document, together with other documents in the LDAP Technical
    Specification (see Section 1 of the specification's road map), obsoletes RFC 2251,
    RFC 2829, and RFC 2830. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
