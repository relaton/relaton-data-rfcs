abstract:
- content: "<p>Layer 2 Virtual Private Networks (L2VPNs) based on Frame Relay or ATM
    circuits have been around a long time; more recently, Ethernet VPNs, including
    Virtual Private LAN Service, have become popular. Traditional L2VPNs often required
    a separate Service Provider infrastructure for each type and yet another for the
    Internet and IP VPNs. In addition, L2VPN provisioning was cumbersome. This document
    presents a new approach to the problem of offering L2VPN services where the L2VPN
    customer's experience is virtually identical to that offered by traditional L2VPNs,
    but such that a Service Provider can maintain a single network for L2VPNs, IP
    VPNs, and the Internet, as well as a common provisioning methodology for all services.
    This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published
    for informational purposes.</p>"
