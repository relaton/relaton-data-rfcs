abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes Linux Netlink, which is used in Linux both
    as an intra-kernel messaging system as well as between kernel and user space.
    \ The focus of this document is to describe Netlink's functionality as a protocol
    between a Forwarding Engine Component (FEC) and a Control Plane Component (CPC),
    the two components that define an IP service.  As a result of this focus, this
    document ignores other uses of Netlink, including its use as a intra-kernel messaging
    system, as an inter- process communication scheme (IPC), or as a configuration
    tool for other non-networking or non-IP network services (such as decnet, etc.).
    \ This document is intended as informational in the context of prior art for the
    ForCES IETF working group.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
