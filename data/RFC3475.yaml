abstract:
- content: "<p>Automatic Switched Optical Network (ASON) is an architecture, specified
    by ITU-T Study Group 15, for the introduction of a control plane for optical networks.
    \ The ASON architecture specifies a set of reference points that defines the relationship
    between the ASON architectural entities.  Signaling over interfaces defined in
    those reference points can make use of protocols that are defined by the IETF
    in the context of Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) work.  This
    document describes Constraint-Based LSP setup using LDP (CR-LDP) extensions for
    signaling over the interfaces defined in the ASON reference points.  The purpose
    of the document is to request that the IANA assigns code points necessary for
    the CR-LDP extensions.  The protocol specifications for the use of the CR-LDP
    extensions are found in ITU-T documents.  This memo provides information for the
    Internet community.</p>"
