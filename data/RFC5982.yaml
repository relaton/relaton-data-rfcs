abstract:
- content: "<p>Flow-based measurement is a popular method for various network monitoring
    usages.  The sharing of flow-based information for monitoring applications having
    different requirements raises some open issues in terms of measurement system
    scalability, flow-based measurement flexibility, and export reliability that IP
    Flow Information Export (IPFIX) Mediation may help resolve.  This document describes
    some problems related to flow-based measurement that network administrators have
    been facing, and then it describes IPFIX Mediation applicability examples along
    with the problems.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;
    it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
