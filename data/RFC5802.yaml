abstract:
- content: "<p>The secure authentication mechanism most widely deployed and used by
    Internet application protocols is the transmission of clear-text passwords over
    a channel protected by Transport Layer Security (TLS). There are some significant
    security concerns with that mechanism, which could be addressed by the use of
    a challenge response authentication mechanism protected by TLS. Unfortunately,
    the challenge response mechanisms presently on the standards track all fail to
    meet requirements necessary for widespread deployment, and have had success only
    in limited use.</p><p>This specification describes a family of Simple Authentication
    and Security Layer (SASL; RFC 4422) authentication mechanisms called the Salted
    Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM), which addresses the security
    concerns and meets the deployability requirements. When used in combination with
    TLS or an equivalent security layer, a mechanism from this family could improve
    the status quo for application protocol authentication and provide a suitable
    choice for a mandatory-to-implement mechanism for future application protocol
    standards. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
