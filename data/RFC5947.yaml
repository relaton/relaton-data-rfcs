abstract:
- content: "<p>This document states requirements for a standardized SIP registration
    mechanism for multiple addresses of record (AORs), the mechanism being suitable
    for deployment by SIP service providers on a large scale in support of small to
    medium sized Private Branch Exchanges (PBXs).  The requirements are for a solution
    that can, as a minimum, support AORs based on E.164 numbers.  This document is
    not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational
    purposes.</p>"
