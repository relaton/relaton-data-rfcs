abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes a method of representing rules for validating
    identifier labels and alternate representations of those labels using Extensible
    Markup Language (XML).  These policies, known as "Label Generation Rulesets" (LGRs),
    are used for the implementation of Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs), for
    example.  The rulesets are used to implement and share that aspect of policy defining
    which labels and Unicode code points are permitted for registrations, which alternative
    code points are considered variants, and what actions may be performed on labels
    containing those variants.</p>
