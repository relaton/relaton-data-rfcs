abstract:
- content: "<p>Network survivability is the ability of a network to recover traffic
    delivery following failure or degradation of network resources. Survivability
    is critical for the delivery of guaranteed network services, such as those subject
    to strict Service Level Agreements (SLAs) that place maximum bounds on the length
    of time that services may be degraded or unavailable.</p><p>The Transport Profile
    of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS-TP) is a packet-based transport technology
    based on the MPLS data plane that reuses many aspects of the MPLS management and
    control planes.</p><p>This document comprises a framework for the provision of
    survivability in an MPLS-TP network; it describes recovery elements, types, methods,
    and topological considerations. To enable data-plane recovery, survivability may
    be supported by the control plane, management plane, and by Operations, Administration,
    and Maintenance (OAM) functions. This document describes mechanisms for recovering
    MPLS-TP Label Switched Paths (LSPs). A detailed description of pseudowire recovery
    in MPLS-TP networks is beyond the scope of this document.</p><p>This document
    is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) / International
    Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort
    to include an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and Pseudowire Emulation
    Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities
    of a packet-based transport network as defined by the ITU-T.</p><p>This document
    is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational
    purposes.</p>"
