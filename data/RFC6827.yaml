abstract:
- content: "<p>The ITU-T has defined an architecture and requirements for operating
    an Automatically Switched Optical Network (ASON).</p><p>The Generalized Multiprotocol
    Label Switching (GMPLS) protocol suite is designed to provide a control plane
    for a range of network technologies. These include optical networks such as time
    division multiplexing (TDM) networks including the Synchronous Optical Network/Synchronous
    Digital Hierarchy (SONET/SDH), Optical Transport Networks (OTNs), and lambda switching
    optical networks.</p><p>The requirements for GMPLS routing to satisfy the requirements
    of ASON routing and an evaluation of existing GMPLS routing protocols are provided
    in other documents. This document defines extensions to the OSPFv2 Link State
    Routing Protocol to meet the requirements for routing in an ASON.</p><p>Note that
    this work is scoped to the requirements and evaluation expressed in RFC 4258 and
    RFC 4652 and the ITU-T Recommendations that were current when those documents
    were written. Future extensions or revisions of this work may be necessary if
    the ITU-T Recommendations are revised or if new requirements are introduced into
    a revision of RFC 4258. This document obsoletes RFC 5787 and updates RFC 5786.
