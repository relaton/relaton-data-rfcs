abstract:
- content: "<p>The DTNRG Research Group has defined the experimental Licklider Transmission
    Protocol (LTP) and the Compressed Bundle Header Encoding (CBHE) mechanism for
    the InterPlanetary Network ('ipn' URI scheme).  Moreover, RFC 5050 defines values
    for the Bundle Protocol administrative record type.  All of these fields are subject
    to a registry.  For the purpose of its research work, the group has created ad
    hoc registries.  As the specifications are stable and have multiple interoperable
    implementations, the group would like to hand off the registries to IANA for official
    management.  This document describes the necessary IANA actions.</p>"
