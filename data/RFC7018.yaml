abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the problem of enabling a large number of systems
    to communicate directly using IPsec to protect the traffic between them. It then
    expands on the requirements for such a solution.</p><p>Manual configuration of
    all possible tunnels is too cumbersome in many such cases. In other cases, the
    IP addresses of endpoints change, or the endpoints may be behind NAT gateways,
    making static configuration impossible. The Auto-Discovery VPN solution will address
    these requirements.</p>"
