abstract:
- content: "<p>Firewalls, packet filters, intrusion detection systems, and the like
    often have difficulty distinguishing between packets that have malicious intent
    and those that are merely unusual.  We define a security flag in the IPv4 header
    as a means of distinguishing the two cases.  This memo provides information for
    the Internet community.</p>"
