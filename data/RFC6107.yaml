abstract:
- content: "<p>Label Switched Paths (LSPs) set up in Multiprotocol Label Switching
    (MPLS) or Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks can be used to form links to carry
    traffic in those networks or in other (client) networks.</p><p>Protocol mechanisms
    already exist to facilitate the establishment of such LSPs and to bundle traffic
    engineering (TE) links to reduce the load on routing protocols. This document
    defines extensions to those mechanisms to support identifying the use to which
    such LSPs are to be put and to enable the TE link endpoints to be assigned addresses
    or unnumbered identifiers during the signaling process. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
