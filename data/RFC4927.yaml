abstract:
- content: "<p>For scalability purposes, a network may comprise multiple Interior
    Gateway Protocol (IGP) areas.  An inter-area Traffic Engineered Label Switched
    Path (TE-LSP) is an LSP that transits through at least two IGP areas.  In a multi-area
    network, topology visibility remains local to a given area, and a head-end Label
    Switching Router (LSR) cannot compute an inter-area shortest constrained path.
    \ One key application of the Path Computation Element (PCE)-based architecture
    is the computation of inter-area TE-LSP paths.  The PCE Communication Protocol
    (PCECP) is used to communicate computation requests from Path Computation Clients
    (PCCs) to PCEs, and to return computed paths in responses.  This document lists
    a detailed set of PCECP-specific requirements for support of inter-area TE-LSP
    path computation.  It complements the generic requirements for a PCE Communication
    Protocol.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
