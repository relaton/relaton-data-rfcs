abstract:
- content: <p>A Wavelength Switched Optical Network (WSON) requires certain key information
    fields be made available to facilitate path computation and the establishment
    of Label Switched Paths (LSPs). The information model described in "Routing and
    Wavelength Assignment Information Model for Wavelength Switched Optical Networks"
    (RFC 7446) shows what information is required at specific points in the WSON.
    Part of the WSON information model contains aspects that may be of general applicability
    to other technologies, while other parts are specific to WSONs.</p><p>This document
    provides efficient, protocol-agnostic encodings for the WSON-specific information
    fields. It is intended that protocol- specific documents will reference this memo
    to describe how information is carried for specific uses. Such encodings can be
    used to extend GMPLS signaling and routing protocols. In addition, these encodings
    could be used by other mechanisms to convey this same information to a Path Computation
    Element (PCE).</p>
