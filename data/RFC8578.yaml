abstract:
- content: <p>This document presents use cases for diverse industries that have in
    common a need for "deterministic flows". "Deterministic" in this context means
    that such flows provide guaranteed bandwidth, bounded latency, and other properties
    germane to the transport of time-sensitive data.  These use cases differ notably
    in their network topologies and specific desired behavior, providing as a group
    broad industry context for Deterministic Networking (DetNet).  For each use case,
    this document will identify the use case, identify representative solutions used
    today, and describe potential improvements that DetNet can enable.</p>
