abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes version 2 of the Internet Key Exchange (IKE)
    protocol. IKE is a component of IPsec used for performing mutual authentication
    and establishing and maintaining security associations (SAs).</p><p>This version
    of the IKE specification combines the contents of what were previously separate
    documents, including Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol
    (ISAKMP, RFC 2408), IKE (RFC 2409), the Internet Domain of Interpretation (DOI,
    RFC 2407), Network Address Translation (NAT) Traversal, Legacy authentication,
    and remote address acquisition.</p><p>Version 2 of IKE does not interoperate with
    version 1, but it has enough of the header format in common that both versions
    can unambiguously run over the same UDP port. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
