abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a fast mechanism for protecting pseudowires
    (PWs) transported by IP/MPLS tunnels against egress endpoint failures, including
    egress attachment circuit (AC) failure, egress provider edge (PE) failure, multi-segment
    PW terminating PE failure, and multi-segment PW switching PE failure.  Operating
    on the basis of multihomed customer edge (CE), redundant PWs, upstream label assignment,
    and context-specific label switching, the mechanism enables local repair to be
    performed by the router upstream adjacent to a failure.  The router can restore
    a PW in the order of tens of milliseconds, by rerouting traffic around the failure
    to a protector through a pre-established bypass tunnel.  Therefore, the mechanism
    can be used to reduce traffic loss before global repair reacts to the failure
    and the network converges on the topology changes due to the failure.</p>"
