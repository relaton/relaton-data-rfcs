abstract:
- content: "<p>In many environments, a component external to a network is called upon
    to perform computations based on the network topology and the current state of
    the connections within the network, including Traffic Engineering (TE) information.
    This is information typically distributed by IGP routing protocols within the
    network.</p><p>This document describes a mechanism by which link-state and TE
    information can be collected from networks and shared with external components
    using the BGP routing protocol. This is achieved using a BGP Network Layer Reachability
    Information (NLRI) encoding format. The mechanism applies to physical and virtual
    (e.g., tunnel) IGP links. The mechanism described is subject to policy control.</p><p>Applications
    of this technique include Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) servers
    and Path Computation Elements (PCEs).</p><p>This document obsoletes RFC 7752 by
    completely replacing that document. It makes some small changes and clarifications
    to the previous specification. This document also obsoletes RFC 9029 by incorporating
    the updates that it made to RFC 7752.</p>"
