abstract:
- content: "<p>Many MPLS implementations have supported multipath techniques, and
    many MPLS deployments have used multipath techniques, particularly in very high-bandwidth
    applications, such as provider IP/MPLS core networks. MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP)
    has strongly discouraged the use of multipath techniques. Some degradation of
    MPLS-TP Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) performance cannot be
    avoided when operating over many types of multipath implementations.</p><p>Using
    MPLS Entropy Labels (RFC 6790), MPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs) can be carried
    over multipath links while also providing a fully MPLS-TP-compliant server layer
    for MPLS-TP LSPs. This document describes the means of supporting MPLS as a server
    layer for MPLS-TP. The use of MPLS-TP LSPs as a server layer for MPLS LSPs is
    also discussed.</p>"
