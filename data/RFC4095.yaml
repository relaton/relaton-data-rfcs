abstract:
- content: <p>This document proposes a mechanism for finding a URI associated with
    a solicitation class keyword, which is defined in RFC 3865, the No Soliciting
    SMTP Service Extension. Solicitation class keywords are simple labels consisting
    of a domain name that has been reversed, such as "org.example.adv". These solicitation
    class keywords are inserted in selected header fields or used in the ESMTP service
    extension, including a new \%"No-Solicit:" header, which can contain one or more
    solicitation class keywords inserted by the sender.</p><p>This document specifies
    an application based on the Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS) described
    in RFC 3401 and related documents. An algorithm is specified to associate a solicitation
    class keyword with a URI which contains further information about the meaning
    and usage of that solicitation class keyword. For example, the registrant of the
    "example.org" domain could use this mechanism to create a URI which contains detailed
    information about the "org.example.adv" solicitation class keyword. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
