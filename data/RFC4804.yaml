abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 3175 specifies aggregation of Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP)
    end-to-end reservations over aggregate RSVP reservations. This document specifies
    aggregation of RSVP end-to-end reservations over MPLS Traffic Engineering (TE)
    tunnels or MPLS Diffserv-aware MPLS Traffic Engineering (DS-TE) tunnels. This
    approach is based on RFC 3175 and simply modifies the corresponding procedures
    for operations over MPLS TE tunnels instead of aggregate RSVP reservations. This
    approach can be used to achieve admission control of a very large number of flows
    in a scalable manner since the devices in the core of the network are unaware
    of the end-to-end RSVP reservations and are only aware of the MPLS TE tunnels.
