abstract:
- content: "<p>Complexity is a widely used parameter in network design, yet there
    is no generally accepted definition of the term. Complexity metrics exist in a
    wide range of research papers, but most of these address only a particular aspect
    of a network, for example, the complexity of a graph or software. While it may
    be impossible to define a metric for overall network complexity, there is a desire
    to better understand the complexity of a network as a whole, as deployed today
    to provide Internet services. This document provides a framework to guide research
    on the topic of network complexity as well as some practical examples for trade-offs
    in networking.</p><p>This document summarizes the work of the IRTF's Network Complexity
    Research Group (NCRG) at the time of its closure. It does not present final results,
    but a snapshot of an ongoing activity, as a basis for future work.</p>"
