abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an updated Overlay Routable Cryptographic Hash
    Identifiers (ORCHID) format that obsoletes that in RFC 4843. These identifiers
    are intended to be used as endpoint identifiers at applications and Application
    Programming Interfaces (APIs) and not as identifiers for network location at the
    IP layer, i.e., locators. They are designed to appear as application-layer entities
    and at the existing IPv6 APIs, but they should not appear in actual IPv6 headers.
    To make them more like regular IPv6 addresses, they are expected to be routable
    at an overlay level. Consequently, while they are considered non-routable addresses
    from the IPv6-layer perspective, all existing IPv6 applications are expected to
    be able to use them in a manner compatible with current IPv6 addresses.</p><p>The
    Overlay Routable Cryptographic Hash Identifiers originally defined in RFC 4843
    lacked a mechanism for cryptographic algorithm agility. The updated ORCHID format
    specified in this document removes this limitation by encoding, in the identifier
    itself, an index to the suite of cryptographic algorithms in use.</p>"
