abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses the problem statement and use cases of IPv6-based
    vehicular networking for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). The main scenarios
    of vehicular communications are vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure
    (V2I), and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications. First, this document explains
    use cases using V2V, V2I, and V2X networking. Next, for IPv6-based vehicular networks,
    it makes a gap analysis of current IPv6 protocols (e.g., IPv6 Neighbor Discovery,
    mobility management, as well as security and privacy).</p>"
