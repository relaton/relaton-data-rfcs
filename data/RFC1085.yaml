abstract:
- content: <p>RFC 1006 describes a mechanism for providing the ISO transport service
    on top of TCP/IP. Once this method is applied, one may implement "real" ISO applications
    on top of TCP/IP-based internets, by simply implementing OSI session, presentation,
    and application services on top of the transport service access point which is
    provided on top of the TCP. Although straight-forward, there are some environments
    in which the richness provided by the OSI application layer is desired, but it
    is nonetheless impractical to implement the underlying OSI infrastructure (i.e.,
    the presentation, session, and transport services on top of the TCP). This memo
    describes an approach for providing "stream-lined" support of OSI application
    services on top of TCP/IP-based internets for such constrained environments. This
    memo proposes a standard for the Internet community.</p>
