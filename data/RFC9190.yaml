abstract:
- content: "<p>The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), defined in RFC 3748,
    provides a standard mechanism for support of multiple authentication methods.
    \ This document specifies the use of EAP-TLS with TLS 1.3 while remaining backwards
    compatible with existing implementations of EAP-TLS.  TLS 1.3 provides significantly
    improved security and privacy, and reduced latency when compared to earlier versions
    of TLS.  EAP-TLS with TLS 1.3 (EAP-TLS 1.3) further improves security and privacy
    by always providing forward secrecy, never disclosing the peer identity, and by
    mandating use of revocation checking when compared to EAP-TLS with earlier versions
    of TLS.  This document also provides guidance on authentication, authorization,
    and resumption for EAP-TLS in general (regardless of the underlying TLS version
    used).  This document updates RFC 5216.</p>"
