abstract:
- content: "<p>This memorandum describes an engineering model which implements a precision
    time-of-day function for a generic operating system.  The model is based on the
    principles of disciplined oscillators and phase-lock loops (PLL) often found in
    the engineering literature.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.
    \ This memo does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.</p>"
