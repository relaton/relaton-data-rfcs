abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines a set of encryption transforms for use in the
    Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) and in the Internet Key Exchange version
    2 (IKEv2) protocols, which are parts of the IP Security (IPsec) protocol suite.
    The transforms are based on the GOST R 34.12-2015 block ciphers (which are named
    "Magma" and "Kuznyechik") in Multilinear Galois Mode (MGM) and the external rekeying
    approach.</p><p>This specification was developed to facilitate implementations
    that wish to support the GOST algorithms. This document does not imply IETF endorsement
    of the cryptographic algorithms used in this document.</p>
