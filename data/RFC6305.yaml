abstract:
- content: "<p>Many sites connected to the Internet make use of IPv4 addresses that
    are not globally unique. Examples are the addresses designated in RFC 1918 for
    private use within individual sites.</p><p>Hosts should never normally send DNS
    reverse-mapping queries for those addresses on the public Internet. However, such
    queries are frequently observed. Authoritative servers are deployed to provide
    authoritative answers to such queries as part of a loosely coordinated effort
    known as the AS112 project.</p><p>Since queries sent to AS112 servers are usually
    not intentional, the replies received back from those servers are typically unexpected.
    Unexpected inbound traffic can trigger alarms on intrusion detection systems and
    firewalls, and operators of such systems often mistakenly believe that they are
    being attacked.</p><p>This document provides background information and technical
    advice to those firewall operators. This document is not an Internet Standards
    Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
