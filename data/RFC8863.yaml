abstract:
- content: "<p>During the process of establishing peer-to-peer connectivity, Interactive
    Connectivity Establishment (ICE) agents can encounter situations where they have
    no candidate pairs to check, and, as a result, conclude that ICE processing has
    failed. However, because additional candidate pairs can be discovered during ICE
    processing, declaring failure at this point may be premature. This document discusses
    when these situations can occur.</p><p>This document updates RFCs 8445 and 8838
    by requiring that an ICE agent wait a minimum amount of time before declaring
    ICE failure, even if there are no candidate pairs left to check.</p>"
