abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo is a report on a meeting about the experimental multimedia
    mail system (and in a sense a status report on that experiment). The meeting was
    held at Bolt Beranek and Newman on 23-24 July 1984 to discuss recent progress
    by groups who are building multimedia mail systems and to discuss a variety of
    issues related to the further development of multimedia systems. Representatives
    were present from BBN, ISI, SRI and Linkabit.</p>"
