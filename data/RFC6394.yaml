abstract:
- content: "<p>Many current applications use the certificate-based authentication
    features in Transport Layer Security (TLS) to allow clients to verify that a connected
    server properly represents a desired domain name.  Typically, this authentication
    has been based on PKIX certificate chains rooted in well-known certificate authorities
    (CAs), but additional information can be provided via the DNS itself.  This document
    describes a set of use cases in which the DNS and DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC)
    could be used to make assertions that support the TLS authentication process.
    \ The main focus of this document is TLS server authentication, but it also covers
    TLS client authentication for applications where TLS clients are identified by
    domain names. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
