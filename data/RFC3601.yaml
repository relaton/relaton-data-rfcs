abstract:
- content: '<p>This memo describes the full set of notations needed to represent a
    text string in a Dial Sequence.  A Dial Sequence is normally composed of Dual
    Tone Multi Frequency (DTMF) elements, plus separators and additional "actions"
    (such as "wait for dialtone", "pause for N secs", etc.) which could be needed
    to successfully establish the connection with the target service: this includes
    the cases where subaddresses or DTMF menu navigation apply.</p>'
