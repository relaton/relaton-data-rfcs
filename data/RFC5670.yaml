abstract:
- content: <p>The objective of Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN) is to protect the
    quality of service (QoS) of inelastic flows within a Diffserv domain in a simple,
    scalable, and robust fashion.  This document defines the two metering and marking
    behaviours of PCN-nodes.  Threshold-metering and -marking marks all PCN-packets
    if the rate of PCN-traffic is greater than a configured rate ("PCN-threshold-rate").  Excess-
    traffic-metering and -marking marks a proportion of PCN-packets, such that the
    amount marked equals the rate of PCN-traffic in excess of a configured rate ("PCN-excess-rate").  The
    level of marking allows PCN-boundary-nodes to make decisions about whether to
    admit or terminate PCN-flows. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
