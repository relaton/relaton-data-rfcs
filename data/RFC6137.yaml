abstract:
- content: "<p>Handling multiple sets of network trouble tickets (TTs) originating
    from different participants' inter-connected network environments poses a series
    of challenges for the involved institutions. A Grid is a good example of such
    a multi-domain project. Each of the participants follows different procedures
    for handling trouble in its domain, according to the local technical and linguistic
    profile. The TT systems of the participants collect, represent, and disseminate
    TT information in different formats.</p><p>As a result, management of the daily
    workload by a central Network Operation Centre (NOC) is a challenge on its own.
    Normalization of TTs to a common format at the central NOC can ease presentation,
    storing, and handling of the TTs. In the present document, we provide a model
    for automating the collection and normalization of the TT received by multiple
    networks forming the Grid. Each of the participants is using its home TT system
    within its domain for handling trouble incidents, whereas the central NOC is gathering
    the tickets in the normalized format for repository and handling. XML is used
    as the common representation language. The model was defined and used as part
    of the networking support activity of the EGEE (Enabling Grids for E-sciencE)
    project. This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</p>"
