abstract:
- content: "<p>It is commonly recognized that the Internet routing and addressing
    architecture is facing challenges in scalability, mobility, multi-homing, and
    inter-domain traffic engineering.  The Routing Research Group is investigating
    an alternate architecture to meet these challenges.  This document consists of
    a prioritized list of design goals for the target architecture.  This document
    is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational
    purposes.</p>"
