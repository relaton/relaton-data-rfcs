abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a deterministic digital signature generation
    procedure.  Such signatures are compatible with standard Digital Signature Algorithm
    (DSA) and Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) digital signatures
    and can be processed with unmodified verifiers, which need not be aware of the
    procedure described therein.  Deterministic signatures retain the cryptographic
    security features associated with digital signatures but can be more easily implemented
    in various environments, since they do not need access to a source of high-quality
    randomness.</p>"
