abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF has developed and documented policies that govern the behavior
    of all IETF participants with respect to Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) about
    which they might reasonably be aware.</p><p>The IETF takes conformance to these
    IPR policies very seriously. However, there has been some ambiguity as to what
    the appropriate sanctions are for the violation of these policies, and how and
    by whom those sanctions are to be applied.</p><p>This document discusses these
    issues and provides a suite of potential actions that can be taken within the
    IETF community in cases related to patents. This document is not an Internet Standards
    Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
