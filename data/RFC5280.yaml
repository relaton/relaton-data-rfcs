- content: "<p>This memo profiles the X.509 v3 certificate and X.509 v2 certificate
    revocation list (CRL) for use in the Internet.  An overview of this approach and
    model is provided as an introduction.  The X.509 v3 certificate format is described
    in detail, with additional information regarding the format and semantics of Internet
    name forms.  Standard certificate extensions are described and two Internet-specific
    extensions are defined.  A set of required certificate extensions is specified.
    \ The X.509 v2 CRL format is described in detail along with standard and Internet-specific
    extensions.  An algorithm for X.509 certification path validation is described.
    \ An ASN.1 module and examples are provided in the appendices. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
