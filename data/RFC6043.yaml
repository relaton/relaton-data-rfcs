abstract:
- content: "<p>The Multimedia Internet KEYing (MIKEY) specification describes a key
    management scheme for real-time applications.  In this document, we note that
    the currently defined MIKEY modes are insufficient to address deployment scenarios
    built around a centralized key management service.  Interest in such deployments
    is increasing.  Therefore, a set of new MIKEY modes that work well in such scenarios
    are defined.  The new modes use a trusted key management service and a ticket
    concept, similar to that in Kerberos.  The new modes also support features used
    by many existing applications, where the exact identity of the other endpoint
    may not be known at the start of the communication session.  This document is
    not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational
    purposes.</p>"
