abstract:
- content: <p>"Music on hold" is one of the features of telephone systems that is
    most desired by buyers of business telephone systems.  Music on hold means that
    when one party to a call has the call "on hold", that party's telephone provides
    an audio stream (often music) to be heard by the other party.  Architectural features
    of SIP make it difficult to implement music on hold in a way that is fully standards-compliant.  The
    implementation of music on hold described in this document is fully effective,
    is standards-compliant, and has a number of advantages over the methods previously
    documented.  In particular, it is less likely to produce peculiar user interface
    effects and more likely to work in systems that perform authentication than the
    music-on-hold method described in Section 2.3 of RFC 5359.</p>
