abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the Hash Of Root Key certificate extension.
    \ This certificate extension is carried in the self-signed certificate for a trust
    anchor, which is often called a Root Certification Authority (CA) certificate.
    \ This certificate extension unambiguously identifies the next public key that
    will be used at some point in the future as the next Root CA certificate, eventually
    replacing the current one.</p>"
