abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the Hash Of Root Key certificate extension.
    This certificate extension is carried in the self-signed certificate for a trust
    anchor, which is often called a Root Certification Authority (CA) certificate.
    This certificate extension unambiguously identifies the next public key that will
    be used at some point in the future as the next Root CA certificate, eventually
    replacing the current one.</p>"
