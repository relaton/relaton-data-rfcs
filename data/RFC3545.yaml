abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a header compression scheme for point to point
    links with packet loss and long delays.  It is based on Compressed Real-time Transport
    Protocol (CRTP), the IP/UDP/RTP header compression described in RFC 2508.  CRTP
    does not perform well on such links: packet loss results in context corruption
    and due to the long delay, many more packets are discarded before the context
    is repaired.  To correct the behavior of CRTP over such links, a few extensions
    to the protocol are specified here.  The extensions aim to reduce context corruption
    by changing the way the compressor updates the context at the decompressor: updates
    are repeated and include updates to full and differential context parameters.
    \ With these extensions, CRTP performs well over links with packet loss, packet
    reordering and long delays. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
