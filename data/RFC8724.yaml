abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the Static Context Header Compression and fragmentation
    (SCHC) framework, which provides both a header compression mechanism and an optional
    fragmentation mechanism. SCHC has been designed with Low-Power Wide Area Networks
    (LPWANs) in mind.</p><p>SCHC compression is based on a common static context stored
    both in the LPWAN device and in the network infrastructure side. This document
    defines a generic header compression mechanism and its application to compress
    IPv6/UDP headers.</p><p>This document also specifies an optional fragmentation
    and reassembly mechanism. It can be used to support the IPv6 MTU requirement over
    the LPWAN technologies. Fragmentation is needed for IPv6 datagrams that, after
    SCHC compression or when such compression was not possible, still exceed the Layer
    2 maximum payload size.</p><p>The SCHC header compression and fragmentation mechanisms
    are independent of the specific LPWAN technology over which they are used. This
    document defines generic functionalities and offers flexibility with regard to
    parameter settings and mechanism choices. This document standardizes the exchange
    over the LPWAN between two SCHC entities. Settings and choices specific to a technology
    or a product are expected to be grouped into profiles, which are specified in
    other documents. Data models for the context and profiles are out of scope.</p>"
