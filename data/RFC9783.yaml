abstract:
- content: "<p>Arm's Platform Security Architecture (PSA) is a family of hardware
    and firmware security specifications, along with open-source reference implementations,
    aimed at helping device makers and chip manufacturers integrate best-practice
    security into their products. Devices that comply with PSA can generate attestation
    tokens as described in this document, which serve as the foundation for various
    protocols, including secure provisioning and network access control. This document
    specifies the structure and semantics of the PSA attestation token.</p><p>The
    PSA attestation token is a profile of the Entity Attestation Token (EAT). This
    specification describes the claims used in an attestation token generated by PSA-compliant
    systems, how these claims are serialized for transmission, and how they are cryptographically
    protected.</p><p>This Informational document is published as an Independent Submission
    to improve interoperability with Arm's architecture. It is not a standard nor
    a product of the IETF.</p>"
