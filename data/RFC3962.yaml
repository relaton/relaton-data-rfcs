abstract:
- content: "<p>The United States National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
    has chosen a new Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), which is significantly faster
    and (it is believed) more secure than the old Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm.
    This document is a specification for the addition of this algorithm to the Kerberos
    cryptosystem suite. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
