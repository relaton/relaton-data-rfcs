abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a procedure for when a Military Message Handling
    System (MMHS) message is composed by one user and is only released to the mail
    transfer system when one or more Authorizing Users authorize release of the message
    by adding the MMHS-Authorizing-Users header field. The resulting message can be
    optionally signed by the sender and/or reviewer, allowing recipients to verify
    both the original signature (if any) and the review signatures.</p>"
