abstract:
- content: <p>The P-Served-User header field was defined based on a requirement from
    the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) in
    order to convey the identity of the served user, his/ her registration state,
    and the session case that applies to that particular communication session and
    application invocation. A session case is metadata that captures the status of
    the session of a served user regardless of whether or not the served user is registered
    or the session originates or terminates with the served user. This document updates
    RFC 5502 by defining a new P-Served-User header field parameter, "orig-cdiv".
    The parameter conveys the session case used by a proxy when handling an originating
    session after Call Diversion (CDIV) services have been invoked for the served
    user. This document also fixes the ABNF in RFC 5502 and provides more guidance
    for using the P-Served-User header field in IP networks.</p>
