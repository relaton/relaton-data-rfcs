abstract:
- content: "<p>The time required to detect movement between networks and to obtain
    (or to continue to use) an IPv4 configuration may be significant as a fraction
    of the total handover latency in moving between points of attachment.  This document
    synthesizes, from experience in the deployment of hosts supporting ARP, DHCP,
    and IPv4 Link-Local addresses, a set of steps known as Detecting Network Attachment
    for IPv4 (DNAv4), in order to decrease the handover latency in moving between
    points of attachment. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
