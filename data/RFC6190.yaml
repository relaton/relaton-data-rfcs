abstract:
- content: <p>This memo describes an RTP payload format for Scalable Video Coding
    (SVC) as defined in Annex G of ITU-T Recommendation H.264, which is technically
    identical to Amendment 3 of ISO/IEC International Standard 14496-10.  The RTP
    payload format allows for packetization of one or more Network Abstraction Layer
    (NAL) units in each RTP packet payload, as well as fragmentation of a NAL unit
    in multiple RTP packets.  Furthermore, it supports transmission of an SVC stream
    over a single as well as multiple RTP sessions.  The payload format defines a
    new media subtype name "H264-SVC", but is still backward compatible to RFC 6184
    since the base layer, when encapsulated in its own RTP stream, must use the H.264
    media subtype name ("H264") and the packetization method specified in RFC 6184.  The
    payload format has wide applicability in videoconferencing, Internet video streaming,
    and high-bitrate entertainment-quality video, among others. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
