abstract:
- content: "<p>This document concludes the For Your Information (FYI) sub-series of
    RFCs, established by RFC 1150 for use by the IETF User Services Area, which no
    longer exists.  The IESG does not intend to make any further additions to this
    RFC sub-series, and this document provides a record of this decision.  This document
    also obsoletes RFC 1150 and changes the status of RFC 1150 to Historic.  This
    document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for
    informational purposes.</p>"
