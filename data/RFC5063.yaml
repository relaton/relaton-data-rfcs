abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes extensions to the Resource Reservation Protocol
    (RSVP) Graceful Restart mechanisms defined in RFC 3473. The extensions enable
    the recovery of RSVP signaling state based on the Path message last sent by the
    node being restarted.</p><p>Previously defined Graceful Restart mechanisms, also
    called recovery from nodal faults, permit recovery of signaling state from adjacent
    nodes when the data plane has retained the associated forwarding state across
    a restart. Those mechanisms do not fully support signaling state recovery on ingress
    nodes or recovery of all RSVP objects.</p><p>The extensions defined in this document
    build on the RSVP Hello extensions defined in RFC 3209, and extensions for state
    recovery on nodal faults defined in RFC 3473. Using these extensions, the restarting
    node can recover all previously transmitted Path state, including the Explicit
    Route Object and the downstream (outgoing) interface identifiers. The extensions
    can also be used to recover signaling state after the restart of an ingress node.</p><p>These
    extensions are not used to create or restore data plane state.</p><p>The extensions
    optionally support the use of Summary Refresh, defined in RFC 2961, to reduce
    the number of messages exchanged during the Recovery Phase when the restarting
    node has recovered signaling state locally for one or more Label Switched Paths
    (LSPs). [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
