abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is intended to be a source of information about the Russian
    Federal standard for digital signatures (GOST R 34.10-2001), which is one of the
    Russian cryptographic standard algorithms (called GOST algorithms).  Recently,
    Russian cryptography is being used in Internet applications, and this document
    has been created as information for developers and users of GOST R 34.10-2001
    for digital signature generation and verification.</p>"
