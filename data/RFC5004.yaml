abstract:
- content: "<p>In this document, we propose an extension to the BGP route selection
    rules that would avoid unnecessary best path transitions between external paths
    under certain conditions. The proposed extension would help the overall network
    stability, and more importantly, would eliminate certain BGP route oscillations
    in which more than one external path from one BGP speaker contributes to the churn.
