abstract:
- content: <p>This memo is an updated version of BBN Report 5775, "End-to-End Functional
    Specification and describes important changes to the functionality of the interface
    between a Host and the PSN, and should be carefully reviewed by anyone involved
    in supporting a host on either the ARPANET or MILNET".  The new End-to-End protocol
    (EE) is being developed in order to correct a number of deficiencies in the old
    EE, to improve its performance and overall throughput, and to better equip the
    Packet Switch Node (PSN, also known as the IMP) to support its current and anticipated
    host population.</p>
