abstract:
- content: "<p>Traffic engineered Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS-TE) is deployed
    in providers' core networks. As providers plan to grow these networks, they need
    to understand whether existing protocols and implementations can support the network
    sizes that they are planning.</p><p>This document presents an analysis of some
    of the scaling concerns for the number of Label Switching Paths (LSPs) in MPLS-TE
    core networks, and examines the value of two techniques (LSP hierarchies and multipoint-to-point
    LSPs) for improving scaling. The intention is to motivate the development of appropriate
    deployment techniques and protocol extensions to enable the application of MPLS-TE
    in large networks.</p><p>This document only considers the question of achieving
    scalability for the support of point-to-point MPLS-TE LSPs. Point-to-multipoint
    MPLS-TE LSPs are for future study. This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.</p>"
