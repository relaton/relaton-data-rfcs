abstract:
- content: <p>Application protocols using Unicode characters in protocol strings need
    to properly handle such strings in order to enforce internationalization rules
    for strings placed in various protocol slots (such as addresses and identifiers)
    and to perform valid comparison operations (e.g., for purposes of authentication
    or authorization).  This document defines a framework enabling application protocols
    to perform the preparation, enforcement, and comparison of internationalized strings
    ("PRECIS") in a way that depends on the properties of Unicode characters and thus
    is agile with respect to versions of Unicode.  As a result, this framework provides
    a more sustainable approach to the handling of internationalized strings than
    the previous framework, known as Stringprep (RFC 3454).  This document obsoletes
    RFC 3454.</p>
