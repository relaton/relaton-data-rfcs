abstract:
- content: "<p>Experience with the Domain Name System (DNS) has shown that there are
    a number of DNS zones that all iterative resolvers and recursive nameservers should
    automatically serve, unless configured otherwise.  RFC 4193 specifies that this
    should occur for D.F.IP6.ARPA.  This document extends the practice to cover the
    IN-ADDR.ARPA zones for RFC 1918 address space and other well-known zones with
    similar characteristics.  This memo documents an Internet Best Current Practice.</p>"
