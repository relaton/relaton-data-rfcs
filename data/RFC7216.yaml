abstract:
- content: "<p>The residential gateway is a device that has become an integral part
    of home networking equipment. Discovering a Location Information Server (LIS)
    is a necessary part of acquiring location information for location-based services.
    However, discovering a LIS when a residential gateway is present poses a configuration
    challenge, requiring a method that is able to work around the obstacle presented
    by the gateway.</p><p>This document describes a solution to this problem. The
    solution provides alternative domain names as input to the LIS discovery process
    based on the network addresses assigned to a Device.</p>"
