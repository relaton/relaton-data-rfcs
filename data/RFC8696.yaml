abstract:
- content: "<p>The invention of a large-scale quantum computer would pose a serious
    challenge for the cryptographic algorithms that are widely deployed today.  The
    Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) supports key transport and key agreement algorithms
    that could be broken by the invention of such a quantum computer.  By storing
    communications that are protected with the CMS today, someone could decrypt them
    in the future when a large-scale quantum computer becomes available.  Once quantum-secure
    key management algorithms are available, the CMS will be extended to support the
    new algorithms if the existing syntax does not accommodate them.  This document
    describes a mechanism to protect today's communication from the future invention
    of a large-scale quantum computer by mixing the output of key transport and key
    agreement algorithms with a pre-shared key.</p>"
