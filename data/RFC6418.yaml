abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes issues encountered by a node attached to multiple
    provisioning domains.  This node receives configuration information from each
    of its provisioning domains, where some configuration objects are global to the
    node and others are local to the interface.  Issues such as selecting the wrong
    interface to send traffic happen when conflicting node-scoped configuration objects
    are received and inappropriately used.  Moreover, other issues are the result
    of simultaneous attachment to multiple networks, such as domain selection or addressing
    and naming space overlaps, regardless of the provisioning mechanism.  While multiple
    provisioning domains are typically seen on nodes with multiple interfaces, this
    document also discusses situations involving single-interface nodes.  This document
    is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational
    purposes.</p>"
