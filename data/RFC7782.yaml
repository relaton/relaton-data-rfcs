abstract:
- content: "<p>TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) active-active
    service provides end stations with flow-level load balance and resilience against
    link failures at the edge of TRILL campuses, as described in RFC 7379.</p><p>This
    document specifies a method by which member RBridges (also referred to as Routing
    Bridges or TRILL switches) in an active-active edge RBridge group use their own
    nicknames as ingress RBridge nicknames to encapsulate frames from attached end
    systems. Thus, remote edge RBridges (who are not in the group) will see one host
    Media Access Control (MAC) address being associated with the multiple RBridges
    in the group. Such remote edge RBridges are required to maintain all those associations
    (i.e., MAC attachments) and to not flip-flop among them (as would occur prior
    to the implementation of this specification). The design goals of this specification
    are discussed herein.</p>"
