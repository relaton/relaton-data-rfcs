abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes an RTP payload format for the High Quality (HQ)
    profile of Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers Standard ST 2042-1,
    known as VC-2. This document describes the transport of HQ Profile VC-2 in RTP
    packets and has applications for low-complexity, high-bandwidth streaming of both
    lossless and lossy compressed video.</p><p>The HQ profile of VC-2 is intended
    for low-latency video compression (with latency potentially on the order of lines
    of video) at high data rates (with compression ratios on the order of 2:1 or 4:1).</p>"
