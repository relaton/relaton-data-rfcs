abstract:
- content: '<p>This document specifies how to use "PKCS #5: Password-Based Cryptography
    Specification Version 2.1" (RFC 8018) to generate a symmetric key from a password
    in conjunction with the Russian national standard GOST algorithms.</p><p>PKCS
    #5 applies a Pseudorandom Function (PRF) -- a cryptographic hash, cipher, or Hash-Based
    Message Authentication Code (HMAC) -- to the input password along with a salt
    value and repeats the process many times to produce a derived key.</p><p>This
    specification has been developed outside the IETF. The purpose of publication
    being to facilitate interoperable implementations that wish to support the GOST
    algorithms. This document does not imply IETF endorsement of the cryptographic
    algorithms used here.</p>'
