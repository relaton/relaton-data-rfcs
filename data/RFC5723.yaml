abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) protocol has a certain
    computational and communication overhead with respect to the number of round trips
    required and the cryptographic operations involved. In remote access situations,
    the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) is used for authentication, which
    adds several more round trips and consequently latency.</p><p>To re-establish
    security associations (SAs) upon a failure recovery condition is time consuming
    especially when an IPsec peer (such as a VPN gateway) needs to re-establish a
    large number of SAs with various endpoints. A high number of concurrent sessions
    might cause additional problems for an IPsec peer during SA re-establishment.</p><p>In
    order to avoid the need to re-run the key exchange protocol from scratch, it would
    be useful to provide an efficient way to resume an IKE/IPsec session. This document
    proposes an extension to IKEv2 that allows a client to re-establish an IKE SA
    with a gateway in a highly efficient manner, utilizing a previously established
    IKE SA.</p><p>A client can reconnect to a gateway from which it was disconnected.
    The proposed approach encodes partial IKE state into an opaque ticket, which can
    be stored on the client or in a centralized store, and is later made available
    to the IKEv2 responder for re-authentication. We use the term ticket to refer
    to the opaque data that is created by the IKEv2 responder. This document does
    not specify the format of the ticket but examples are provided. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
