abstract:
- content: <p>"DomainKeys" creates a domain-level authentication framework for email
    by using public key technology and the DNS to prove the provenance and contents
    of an email.</p><p>This document defines a framework for digitally signing email
    on a per-domain basis. The ultimate goal of this framework is to unequivocally
    prove and protect identity while retaining the semantics of Internet email as
    it is known today.</p><p>Proof and protection of email identity may assist in
    the global control of "spam" and "phishing". This memo defines a Historic Document
    for the Internet community.</p>
