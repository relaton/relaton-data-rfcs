abstract:
- content: "<p>Several protocols have been specified in the Routing Area of the IETF
    using a common variant of the Backus-Naur Form (BNF) of representing message syntax.
    However, there is no formal definition of this version of BNF.</p><p>There is
    value in using the same variant of BNF for the set of protocols that are commonly
    used together. This reduces confusion and simplifies implementation.</p><p>Updating
    existing documents to use some other variant of BNF that is already formally documented
    would be a substantial piece of work.</p><p>This document provides a formal definition
    of the variant of BNF that has been used (that we call Routing BNF) and makes
    it available for use by new protocols. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
