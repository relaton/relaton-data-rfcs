abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo discusses an extension to a Bridge Protocol to detect and
    disclose changes in heighbouring host address parameters in a Multi-Lan system
    of Ethernets.  The problem is one which is appearing more and more regularly as
    the interconnected systems grow larger on Campuses and in Commercial Institutions.
    \ This RFC suggests a protocol enhancement for the Internet community, and requests
    discussion and suggestions for improvements.</p>"
