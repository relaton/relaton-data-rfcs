abstract:
- content: "<p>Multimedia Internet Keying (MIKEY) is a key management protocol that
    can be used for \\%real-time applications. In particular, it has been defined
    focusing on the support of the Secure \\%Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP).
    MIKEY itself is standardized within RFC 3830 and defines four key distribution
    methods. Moreover, it is defined to allow extensions of the protocol. As MIKEY
    becomes more and more accepted, extensions to the base protocol arise, especially
    in terms of additional key distribution methods but also in terms of payload enhancements.</p><p>This
    document provides an overview about the MIKEY base document in general as well
    as the existing extensions for MIKEY, which have been defined or are in the process
    of definition. It is intended as an additional source of information for developers
    or architects to provide more insight in use case scenarios and motivations as
    well as advantages and disadvantages for the different key distribution schemes.
    The use cases discussed in this document are strongly related to dedicated SIP
    call scenarios providing challenges for key management in general, among them
    media before Session Description Protocol (SDP) answer, forking, and shared key
    conferencing. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
