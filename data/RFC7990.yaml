abstract:
- content: "<p>In order to improve the readability of RFCs while supporting their
    archivability, the canonical format of the RFC Series will be transitioning from
    plain-text ASCII to XML using the xml2rfc version 3 vocabulary; different publication
    formats will be rendered from that base document. With these changes comes an
    increase in complexity for authors, consumers, and the publisher of RFCs. This
    document serves as the framework that provides the problem statement, lays out
    a road map of the documents that capture the specific requirements, and describes
    the transition plan.</p>"
