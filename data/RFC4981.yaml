abstract:
- content: "<p>The pace of research on peer-to-peer (P2P) networking in the last five
    years warrants a critical survey. P2P has the makings of a disruptive technology
    -- it can aggregate enormous storage and processing resources while minimizing
    entry and scaling costs.</p><p>Failures are common amongst massive numbers of
    distributed peers, though the impact of individual failures may be less than in
    conventional architectures. Thus, the key to realizing P2P's potential in applications
    other than casual file sharing is robustness.</p><p>P2P search methods are first
    couched within an overall P2P taxonomy. P2P indexes for simple key lookup are
    assessed, including those based on Plaxton trees, rings, tori, butterflies, de
    Bruijn graphs, and skip graphs. Similarly, P2P indexes for keyword lookup, information
    retrieval and data management are explored. Finally, early efforts to optimize
    range, multi-attribute, join, and aggregation queries over P2P indexes are reviewed.
    Insofar as they are available in the primary literature, robustness mechanisms
    and metrics are highlighted throughout. However, the low-level mechanisms that
    most affect robustness are not well isolated in the literature. Recommendations
    are given for future research. This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.</p>"
