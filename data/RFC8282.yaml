abstract:
- content: "<p>The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides path computation functions
    in support of traffic engineering in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and
    Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks.</p><p>MPLS and GMPLS networks may be constructed
    from layered service networks. It is advantageous for overall network efficiency
    to provide end-to-end traffic engineering across multiple network layers through
    a process called inter-layer traffic engineering. PCE is a candidate solution
    for such requirements.</p><p>The PCE Communication Protocol (PCEP) is designed
    as a communication protocol between Path Computation Clients (PCCs) and PCEs.
    This document presents PCEP extensions for inter-layer traffic engineering.</p>"
