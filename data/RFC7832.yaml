abstract:
- content: "<p>Federated identity is typically associated with web-based services
    at present, but there is growing interest in its application in non-web-based
    contexts.  The goal of this memo is to document a selection of the wide variety
    of these contexts whose user experience could be improved through the use of technologies
    based on the Application Bridging for Federated Access Beyond web (ABFAB) architecture
    and specifications.</p>"
