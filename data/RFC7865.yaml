abstract:
- content: "<p>Session recording is a critical requirement in many communications
    environments, such as call centers and financial trading organizations.  In some
    of these environments, all calls must be recorded for regulatory, compliance,
    and consumer protection reasons.  The recording of a session is typically performed
    by sending a copy of a media stream to a recording device.  This document describes
    the metadata model as viewed by the Session Recording Server (SRS) and the recording
    metadata format.</p>"
