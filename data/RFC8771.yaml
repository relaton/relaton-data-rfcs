abstract:
- content: <p>Domain Names were designed for humans, IP addresses were not.  But more
    than 30 years after the introduction of the DNS, a minority of mankind persists
    in invading the realm of machine-to-machine communication by reading, writing,
    misspelling, memorizing, permuting, and confusing IP addresses.  This memo describes
    the Internationalized Deliberately Unreadable Network NOtation ("I-DUNNO"), a
    notation designed to replace current textual representations of IP addresses with
    something that is not only more concise but will also discourage this small, but
    obviously important, subset of human activity.</p>
