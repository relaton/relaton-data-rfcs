abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines distributed mobility anchoring in terms of the
    different configurations and functions to provide IP mobility support.  A network
    may be configured with distributed mobility anchoring functions for both network-based
    or host-based mobility support, depending on the network's needs.  In a distributed
    mobility anchoring environment, multiple anchors are available for mid-session
    switching of an IP prefix anchor.  To start a new flow or to handle a flow not
    requiring IP session continuity as a mobile node moves to a new network, the flow
    can be started or restarted using an IP address configured from the new IP prefix
    anchored to the new network.  If the flow needs to survive the change of network,
    there are solutions that can be used to enable IP address mobility.  This document
    describes different anchoring approaches, depending on the IP mobility needs,
    and how this IP address mobility is handled by the network.</p>"
