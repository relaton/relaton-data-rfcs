abstract:
- content: "<p>To protect user data and privacy, Internet transport protocols have
    supported payload encryption and authentication for some time. Such encryption
    and authentication are now also starting to be applied to the transport protocol
    headers. This helps avoid transport protocol ossification by middleboxes, mitigate
    attacks against the transport protocol, and protect metadata about the communication.
    Current operational practice in some networks inspect transport header information
    within the network, but this is no longer possible when those transport headers
    are encrypted.</p><p>This document discusses the possible impact when network
    traffic uses a protocol with an encrypted transport header. It suggests issues
    to consider when designing new transport protocols or features.</p>"
