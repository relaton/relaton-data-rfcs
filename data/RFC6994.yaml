abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how the experimental TCP option codepoints
    can concurrently support multiple TCP extensions, even within the same connection,
    using a new IANA TCP experiment identifier. This approach is robust to experiments
    that are not registered and to those that do not use this sharing mechanism. It
    is recommended for all new TCP options that use these codepoints.</p>"
