- content: "<p>The RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) is used in conjunction with the Real-time
    Transport Protocol (RTP) to provide a variety of short-term and long-term reception
    statistics.  The available reporting may include aggregate information across
    longer periods of time as well as individual packet reporting.  This document
    specifies a report computing the bytes discarded from the de-jitter buffer after
    successful reception.</p>"
