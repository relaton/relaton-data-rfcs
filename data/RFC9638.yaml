abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF Network Virtualization Overlays (NVO3) Working Group developed
    considerations for a common encapsulation that addresses various network virtualization
    overlay technical concerns. This document provides a record, for the benefit of
    the IETF community, of the considerations arrived at by the NVO3 Working Group
    starting from the output of the NVO3 encapsulation Design Team. These considerations
    may be helpful with future deliberations by working groups over the choice of
    encapsulation formats.</p><p>There are implications of having different encapsulations
    in real environments consisting of both software and hardware implementations
    and within and spanning multiple data centers. For example, Operations, Administration,
    and Maintenance (OAM) functions such as path MTU discovery become challenging
    with multiple encapsulations along the data path.</p><p>Based on these considerations,
    the NVO3 Working Group determined that Generic Network Virtualization Encapsulation
    (Geneve) with a few modifications is the common encapsulation. This document provides
    more details, particularly in Section 7.</p>"
