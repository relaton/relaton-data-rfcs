abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 5614 (OSPF-MDR) extends OSPF to support mobile ad hoc networks
    (MANETs) by specifying its operation on the new OSPF interface of type MANET.
    \ This document describes the use of OSPF-MDR (MANET Designated Router) in a single-hop
    broadcast network, which is a special case of a MANET in which each router is
    a (one-hop) neighbor of each other router.  Unlike an OSPF broadcast interface,
    such an interface can have a different cost associated with each neighbor.  The
    document includes configuration recommendations and simplified mechanisms that
    can be used in single-hop broadcast networks.</p>"
