abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies Wave and Equation Based Rate Control (WEBRC),
    which provides rate and congestion control for data delivery.  WEBRC is specifically
    designed to support protocols using IP multicast.  It provides multiple-rate,
    congestion-controlled delivery to receivers, i.e., different receivers joined
    to the same session may be receiving packets at different rates depending on the
    bandwidths of their individual connections to the sender and on competing traffic
    along these connections.  WEBRC requires no feedback from receivers to the sender,
    i.e., it is a completely receiver-driven congestion control protocol.  Thus, it
    is designed to scale to potentially massive numbers of receivers attached to a
    session from a single sender.  Furthermore, because each individual receiver adjusts
    to the available bandwidth between the sender and that receiver, there is the
    potential to deliver data to each individual receiver at the fastest possible
    rate for that receiver, even in a highly heterogeneous network architecture, using
    a single sender.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet
    community.</p>"
