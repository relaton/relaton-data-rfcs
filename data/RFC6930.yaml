abstract:
- content: "<p>The IPv6 Rapid Deployment on IPv4 Infrastructures (6rd) provides both
    IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity services simultaneously during the IPv4/IPv6 coexistence
    period.  The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) 6rd option has been defined
    to configure the 6rd Customer Edge (CE).  However, in many networks, the configuration
    information may be stored in the Authentication Authorization and Accounting (AAA)
    servers, while user configuration is mainly acquired from a Broadband Network
    Gateway (BNG) through the DHCP protocol.  This document defines a Remote Authentication
    Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) attribute that carries 6rd configuration information
    from the AAA server to BNGs.</p>"
