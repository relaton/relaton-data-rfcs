abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a bandwidth saving method for exporting Flow
    or packet information using the IP Flow Information eXport (IPFIX) protocol. As
    the Packet Sampling (PSAMP) protocol is based on IPFIX, these considerations are
    valid for PSAMP exports as well.</p><p>This method works by separating information
    common to several Flow Records from information specific to an individual Flow
    Record. Common Flow information is exported only once in a Data Record defined
    by an Options Template, while the rest of the specific Flow information is associated
    with the common information via a unique identifier. This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.</p>"
