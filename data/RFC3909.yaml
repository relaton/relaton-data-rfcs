abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification describes a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
    (LDAP) extended operation to cancel (or abandon) an outstanding operation.  Unlike
    the LDAP Abandon operation, but like the X.511 Directory Access Protocol (DAP)
    Abandon operation, this operation has a response which provides an indication
    of its outcome. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
