abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an RTCP XR report block, which reports packet
    transport parameters.  The report block was developed by BT for pre-standards
    use in BT's next-generation network.  This document has been produced to describe
    the report block in sufficient detail to register the block type with IANA in
    accordance with the Specification Required policy of RFC 3611.  This specification
    does not standardise the new report block for use outside BT's network.  This
    memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
