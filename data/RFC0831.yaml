abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of this RFC is to focus discussion on a particular Internet
    problem: a backup path for software maintenance of the European sector of the
    Internet, for use when SATNET is partitioned.  We propose a mechanism, based upon
    the Source Routing option of IP, to reach European Internet sites via the VAN
    Gateway and UCL.  This proposal is not intended as a standard at this time.</p>"
