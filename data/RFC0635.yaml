abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper presents some theoretical and practical motivations for
    the redesign of the ARPANET communication protocols. Issues concerning multipacket
    messages, Host retransmission, duplicate detection, sequencing, and acknowledgment
    are discussed. Simplifications to the IMP/IMP protocol are proposed on the assumption
    that new Host level protocols are adopted. Familiarity with the current protocol
    designs is probably necessary since many of the arguments refer to details in
    the present protocol design.</p>"
