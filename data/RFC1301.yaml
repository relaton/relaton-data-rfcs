abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes a protocol for reliable transport that utilizes
    the multicast capability of applicable lower layer networking architectures. The
    transport definition permits an arbitrary number of transport providers to perform
    realtime collaborations without requiring networking clients (aka, applications)
    to possess detailed knowledge of the population or geographical dispersion of
    the participating members. It is not network architectural specific, but does
    implicitly require some form of multicasting (or broadcasting) at the data link
    level, as well as some means of communicating that capability up through the layers
    to the transport. This memo provides information for the Internet community. It
    does not specify an Internet standard.</p>"
