abstract:
- content: "<p>The Static Context Header Compression and fragmentation (SCHC) specification
    (RFC 8724) describes generic header compression and fragmentation techniques for
    Low-Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) technologies. SCHC is a generic mechanism
    designed for great flexibility so that it can be adapted for any of the LPWAN
    technologies.</p><p>This document defines a profile of SCHC (RFC 8724) for use
    in LoRaWAN networks and provides elements such as efficient parameterization and
    modes of operation.</p>"
