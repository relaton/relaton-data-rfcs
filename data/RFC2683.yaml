abstract:
- content: "<p>The IMAP4 specification describes a rich protocol for use in building
    clients and servers for storage, retrieval, and manipulation of electronic mail.
    \ Because the protocol is so rich and has so many implementation choices, there
    are often trade-offs that must be made and issues that must be considered when
    designing such clients and servers.  This document attempts to outline these issues
    and to make recommendations in order to make the end products as interoperable
    as possible.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
