abstract:
- content: "<p>This RFC describes an alternate approach of dealing with reassembly
    which reduces the bookkeeping problem to a minimum, and requires only one buffer
    for storage equal in size to the final datagram being reassembled, which can reassemble
    a datagram from any number of fragments arriving in any order with any possible
    pattern of overlap and duplication, and which is appropriate for almost any sort
    of operating system.</p>"
