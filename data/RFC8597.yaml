abstract:
- content: "<p>Software-Defined Networking (SDN) advocates for the separation of the
    control plane from the data plane in the network nodes and its logical centralization
    on one or a set of control entities. Most of the network and/or service intelligence
    is moved to these control entities. Typically, such an entity is seen as a compendium
    of interacting control functions in a vertical, tightly integrated fashion. The
    relocation of the control functions from a number of distributed network nodes
    to a logical central entity conceptually places together a number of control capabilities
    with different purposes. As a consequence, the existing solutions do not provide
    a clear separation between transport control and services that rely upon transport
    capabilities.</p><p>This document describes an approach called Cooperating Layered
    Architecture for Software-Defined Networking (CLAS), wherein the control functions
    associated with transport are differentiated from those related to services in
    such a way that they can be provided and maintained independently and can follow
    their own evolution path.</p>"
