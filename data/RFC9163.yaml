abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines a new HTTP header field named "Expect-CT", which
    allows web host operators to instruct user agents (UAs) to expect valid Signed
    Certificate Timestamps (SCTs) to be served on connections to these hosts. Expect-CT
    allows web host operators to discover misconfigurations in their Certificate Transparency
    (CT) deployments. Further, web host operators can use Expect-CT to ensure that
    if a UA that supports Expect-CT accepts a misissued certificate, that certificate
    will be discoverable in Certificate Transparency logs.</p>
