- content: "<p>This document is being published primarily for historical context and
    comparative purposes, essentially to document some thoughts about how 1591 might
    have been interpreted and adjusted by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
    (IANA) and ICANN to better reflect today's world while retaining characteristics
    and policies that have proven to be effective in supporting Internet growth and
    stability.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
