abstract:
- content: "<p>The IPsec, Internet Key Exchange (IKE), and IKEv2 protocols rely on
    security algorithms to provide privacy and authentication between the initiator
    and responder.  There are many such algorithms available, and two IPsec systems
    cannot interoperate unless they are using the same algorithms.  This document
    specifies optional suites of algorithms and attributes that can be used to simplify
    the administration of IPsec when used in manual keying mode, with IKEv1 or with
    IKEv2. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
