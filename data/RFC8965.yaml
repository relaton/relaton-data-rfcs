abstract:
- content: "<p>Babel is a routing protocol based on the distance-vector algorithm
    augmented with mechanisms for loop avoidance and starvation avoidance. This document
    describes a number of niches where Babel has been found to be useful and that
    are arguably not adequately served by more mature protocols.</p>"
