abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Access Node Control Protocol (ANCP). ANCP
    operates between a Network Access Server (NAS) and an Access Node (e.g., a Digital
    Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer (DSLAM)) in a multi-service reference architecture
    in order to perform operations related to Quality of Service, service, and subscribers.
    Use cases for ANCP are documented in RFC 5851. As well as describing the base
    ANCP protocol, this document specifies capabilities for Digital Subscriber Line
    (DSL) topology discovery, line configuration, and remote line connectivity testing.
    The design of ANCP allows for protocol extensions in other documents if they are
    needed to support other use cases and other access technologies.</p><p>ANCP is
    based on the General Switch Management Protocol version 3 (GSMPv3) described in
    RFC 3292, but with many modifications and extensions, to the point that the two
    protocols are not interoperable. For this reason, ANCP was assigned a separate
    version number to distinguish it. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
