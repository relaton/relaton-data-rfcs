abstract:
- content: "<p>Technology in the optical domain is constantly evolving, and, as a
    consequence, new equipment providing lambda switching capability has been developed
    and is currently being deployed.</p><p>Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) is a family of
    protocols that can be used to operate networks built from a range of technologies
    including wavelength (or lambda) switching. For this purpose, GMPLS defined a
    wavelength label as only having significance between two neighbors. Global wavelength
    semantics are not considered.</p><p>In order to facilitate interoperability in
    a network composed of next generation lambda-switch-capable equipment, this document
    defines a standard lambda label format that is compliant with the Dense Wavelength
    Division Multiplexing (DWDM) and Coarse Wavelength Division Multiplexing (CWDM)
    grids defined by the International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization
    Sector. The label format defined in this document can be used in GMPLS signaling
    and routing protocols. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
