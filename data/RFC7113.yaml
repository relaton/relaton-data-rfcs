abstract:
- content: "<p>The IPv6 Router Advertisement Guard (RA-Guard) mechanism is commonly
    employed to mitigate attack vectors based on forged ICMPv6 Router Advertisement
    messages. Many existing IPv6 deployments rely on RA-Guard as the first line of
    defense against the aforementioned attack vectors. However, some implementations
    of RA-Guard have been found to be prone to circumvention by employing IPv6 Extension
    Headers. This document describes the evasion techniques that affect the aforementioned
    implementations and formally updates RFC 6105, such that the aforementioned RA-Guard
    evasion vectors are eliminated.</p>"
