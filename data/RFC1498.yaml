abstract:
- content: "<p>This brief paper offers a perspective on the subject of names of destinations
    in data communication networks.  It suggests two ideas: First, it is helpful to
    distinguish among four different kinds of objects that may be named as the destination
    of a packet in a network.  Second, the operating system concept of binding is
    a useful way to describe the relations among the four kinds of objects.  This
    memo provides information for the Internet community.  It does not specify an
    Internet standard.</p>"
