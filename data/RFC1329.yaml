abstract:
- content: "<p>In this document an idea is submitted how IP and ARP can be used on
    inhomogeneous FDDI networks (FDDI networks with single MAC and dual MAC stations)
    by introducing a new protocol layer in the protocol suite of the dual MAC stations.
    This memo provides information for the Internet community. It does not specify
    an Internet standard.</p>"
