abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies QUIC version 2, which is identical to QUIC version
    1 except for some trivial details. Its purpose is to combat various ossification
    vectors and exercise the version negotiation framework. It also serves as a template
    for the minimum changes in any future version of QUIC.</p><p>Note that "version
    2" is an informal name for this proposal that indicates it is the second version
    of QUIC to be published as a Standards Track document. The protocol specified
    here uses a version number other than 2 in the wire image, in order to minimize
    ossification risks.</p>
