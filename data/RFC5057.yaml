abstract:
- content: "<p>Several methods in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) can create
    an association between endpoints known as a dialog. Some of these methods can
    also create a different, but related, association within an existing dialog. These
    multiple associations, or dialog usages, require carefully coordinated processing
    as they have independent life-cycles, but share common dialog state. Processing
    multiple dialog usages correctly is not completely understood. What is understood
    is difficult to implement.</p><p>This memo argues that multiple dialog usages
    should be avoided. It discusses alternatives to their use and clarifies essential
    behavior for elements that cannot currently avoid them.</p><p>This is an informative
    document and makes no normative statements of any kind. This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.</p>"
