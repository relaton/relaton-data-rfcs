abstract:
- content: "<p>Many protocols make use of identifiers consisting of constants and
    other well-known values. Even after a protocol has been defined and deployment
    has begun, new values may need to be assigned (e.g., for a new option type in
    DHCP, or a new encryption or authentication transform for IPsec). To ensure that
    such quantities have consistent values and interpretations across all implementations,
    their assignment must be administered by a central authority. For IETF protocols,
    that role is provided by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).</p><p>In
    order for IANA to manage a given namespace prudently, it needs guidelines describing
    the conditions under which new values can be assigned or when modifications to
    existing values can be made. If IANA is expected to play a role in the management
    of a namespace, IANA must be given clear and concise instructions describing that
    role. This document discusses issues that should be considered in formulating
    a policy for assigning values to a namespace and provides guidelines for authors
    on the specific text that must be included in documents that place demands on
    IANA.</p><p>This document obsoletes RFC 2434. This document specifies an Internet
    Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and
    suggestions for improvements.</p>"
