abstract:
- content: <p>Intent and Intent-Based Networking are taking the industry by storm.
    At the same time, terms related to Intent-Based Networking are often used loosely
    and inconsistently, in many cases overlapping and confused with other concepts
    such as "policy." This document clarifies the concept of "intent" and provides
    an overview of the functionality that is associated with it. The goal is to contribute
    towards a common and shared understanding of terms, concepts, and functionality
    that can be used as the foundation to guide further definition of associated research
    and engineering problems and their solutions.</p><p>This document is a product
    of the IRTF Network Management Research Group (NMRG). It reflects the consensus
    of the research group, having received many detailed and positive reviews by research
    group participants. It is published for informational purposes.</p>
