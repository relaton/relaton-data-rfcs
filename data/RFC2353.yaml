abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines a method with which HPR nodes can use IP networks
    for communication, and the enhancements to APPN required by this method.  This
    memo also describes an option set that allows the use of the APPN connection network
    model to allow HPR nodes to use IP networks for communication without having to
    predefine link connections.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.
    \ It does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.</p>"
