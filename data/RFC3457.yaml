abstract:
- content: "<p>IPsec offers much promise as a secure remote access mechanism.  However,
    there are a number of differing remote access scenarios, each having some shared
    and some unique requirements.  A thorough understanding of these requirements
    is necessary in order to effectively evaluate the suitability of a specific set
    of mechanisms for any particular remote access scenario.  This document enumerates
    the requirements for a number of common remote access scenarios.  This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.</p>"
