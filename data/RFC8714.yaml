abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo updates the process for selection of Trustees for the IETF
    Trust. Previously, the IETF Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) members
    also acted as Trustees, but the IAOC has been eliminated as part of an update
    to the structure of the IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA). This memo
    specifies that the Trustees shall be selected separately.</p><p>This memo obsoletes
    RFC 4371. The changes relate only to the selection of Trustees. All other aspects
    of the IETF Trust remain as they are today.</p>"
