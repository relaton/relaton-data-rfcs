abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Equal Cost Multipath (ECMP) behavior of
    currently deployed MPLS networks.  This document makes best practice recommendations
    for anyone defining an application to run over an MPLS network that wishes to
    avoid the reordering that can result from transmission of different packets from
    the same flow over multiple different equal cost paths.  These recommendations
    rely on inspection of the IP version number field in packets.  Despite the heuristic
    nature of the recommendations, they provide a relatively safe way to operate MPLS
    networks, even if future allocations of IP version numbers were made for some
    purpose.  This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet
    Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.</p>"
