abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the information contained in a conceptual database
    of long-lived cryptographic keys used by many different routing protocols for
    message security.  The database is designed to support both manual and automated
    key management.  In addition to describing the schema for the database, this document
    describes the operations that can be performed on the database as well as the
    requirements for the routing protocols that wish to use the database.  In many
    typical scenarios, the protocols do not directly use the long-lived key, but rather
    a key derivation function is used to derive a short-lived key from a long-lived
    key.</p>"
