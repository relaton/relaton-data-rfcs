abstract:
- content: "<p>HTTP Digest, as specified in RFC 2617, is known to be vulnerable to
    man-in-the-middle attacks if the client fails to authenticate the server in TLS,
    or if the same passwords are used for authentication in some other context without
    TLS.  This is a general problem that exists not just with HTTP Digest, but also
    with other IETF protocols that use tunneled authentication.  This document specifies
    version 2 of the HTTP Digest AKA algorithm (RFC 3310).  This algorithm can be
    implemented in a way that it is resistant to the man-in-the-middle attack.  This
    memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
