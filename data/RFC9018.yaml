abstract:
- content: "<p>DNS Cookies, as specified in RFC 7873, are a lightweight DNS transaction
    security mechanism that provide limited protection to DNS servers and clients
    against a variety of denial-of-service amplification, forgery, or cache-poisoning
    attacks by off-path attackers.</p><p>This document updates RFC 7873 with precise
    directions for creating Server Cookies so that an anycast server set including
    diverse implementations will interoperate with standard clients, with suggestions
    for constructing Client Cookies in a privacy-preserving fashion, and with suggestions
    on how to update a Server Secret. An IANA registry listing the methods and associated
    pseudorandom function suitable for creating DNS Server Cookies has been created
    with the method described in this document as the first and, as of the time of
    publication, only entry.</p>"
