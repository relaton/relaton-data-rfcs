abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobile IP ensures correct routing of packets to a mobile node as the
    mobile node changes its point of attachment to the Internet. However, it is also
    required to provide proper Quality of Service (QoS) forwarding treatment to the
    mobile node's packet stream at the intermediate nodes in the network, so that
    QoS-sensitive IP services can be supported over Mobile IP. This document describes
    requirements for an IP QoS mechanism for its satisfactory operation with Mobile
    IP. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
