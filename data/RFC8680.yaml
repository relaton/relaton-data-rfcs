abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 6363 describes a framework for using Forward Error Correction (FEC)
    codes to provide protection against packet loss. The framework supports applying
    FEC to arbitrary packet flows over unreliable transport and is primarily intended
    for real-time, or streaming, media. However, FECFRAME as per RFC 6363 is restricted
    to block FEC codes. This document updates RFC 6363 to support FEC codes based
    on a sliding encoding window, in addition to block FEC codes, in a backward-compatible
    way. During multicast/broadcast real-time content delivery, the use of sliding
    window codes significantly improves robustness in harsh environments, with less
    repair traffic and lower FEC-related added latency.</p>"
