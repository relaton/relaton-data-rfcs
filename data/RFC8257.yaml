abstract:
- content: "<p>This Informational RFC describes Data Center TCP (DCTCP): a TCP congestion
    control scheme for data-center traffic.  DCTCP extends the Explicit Congestion
    Notification (ECN) processing to estimate the fraction of bytes that encounter
    congestion rather than simply detecting that some congestion has occurred.  DCTCP
    then scales the TCP congestion window based on this estimate.  This method achieves
    high-burst tolerance, low latency, and high throughput with shallow- buffered
    switches.  This memo also discusses deployment issues related to the coexistence
    of DCTCP and conventional TCP, discusses the lack of a negotiating mechanism between
    sender and receiver, and presents some possible mitigations.  This memo documents
    DCTCP as currently implemented by several major operating systems.  DCTCP, as
    described in this specification, is applicable to deployments in controlled environments
    like data centers, but it must not be deployed over the public Internet without
    additional measures.</p>"
