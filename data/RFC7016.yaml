abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes Adobe's Secure Real-Time Media Flow Protocol (RTMFP),
    an endpoint-to-endpoint communication protocol designed to securely transport
    parallel flows of real-time video, audio, and data messages, as well as bulk data,
    over IP networks.  RTMFP has features that make it effective for peer-to-peer
    (P2P) as well as client-server communications, even when Network Address Translators
    (NATs) are used.</p>"
