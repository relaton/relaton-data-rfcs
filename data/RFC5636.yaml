abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a practical architecture and protocols for offering
    privacy for a user who requests and uses an X.509 certificate containing a pseudonym,
    while still retaining the ability to map such a certificate to the real user who
    requested it.  The architecture is compatible with IETF certificate request formats
    such as PKCS10 (RFC 2986) and CMC (RFC 5272).  The architecture separates the
    authorities involved in issuing a certificate: one for verifying ownership of
    a private key (Blind Issuer) and the other for validating the contents of a certificate
    (Anonymity Issuer).  The end entity (EE) certificates issued under this model
    are called Traceable Anonymous Certificates (TACs).  This memo defines an Experimental
    Protocol for the Internet community.</p>"
