abstract:
- content: "<p>Overload occurs in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) networks when
    proxies and user agents have insufficient resources to complete the processing
    of a request.  SIP provides limited support for overload handling through its
    503 response code, which tells an upstream element that it is overloaded.  However,
    numerous problems have been identified with this mechanism.  This document summarizes
    the problems with the existing 503 mechanism, and provides some requirements for
    a solution.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
