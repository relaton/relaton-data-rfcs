abstract:
- content: '<p>The RFC Editor model described in this document divides the responsibilities
    for the RFC Series into three functions: the RFC Series Editor, the RFC Production
    Center, and the RFC Publisher. Internet Architecture Board (IAB) oversight via
    the RFC Series Oversight Committee (RSOC) is described, as is the relationship
    between the IETF Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) and the RSOC. This
    document reflects the experience gained with "RFC Editor Model (Version 1)", documented
    in RFC 5620, and obsoletes that document. This document is not an Internet Standards
    Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>'
