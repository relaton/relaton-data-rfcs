abstract:
- content: "<p>This note describes a simple out-of-band protocol to ease setup of
    the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) provisioning and publication protocols
    between two parties. The protocol is encoded in a small number of XML messages,
    which can be passed back and forth by any mutually agreeable means which provides
    acceptable data integrity and authentication.</p><p>This setup protocol is not
    part of the provisioning or publication protocol; rather, it is intended to simplify
    configuration of these protocols by setting up relationships and exchanging keying
    material used to authenticate those relationships.</p>"
