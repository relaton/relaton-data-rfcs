abstract:
- content: "<p>This white paper expresses some personal opinions on IPng engineering
    considerations, based on experience with DECnet Phase V transition.  It suggests
    breaking down the IPng decisions and transition tasks into smaller parts so they
    can be tackled early by the relevant experts.  This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.  This memo does not specify an Internet standard of
    any kind.</p>"
