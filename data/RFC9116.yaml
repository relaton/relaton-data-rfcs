abstract:
- content: <p>When security vulnerabilities are discovered by researchers, proper
    reporting channels are often lacking.  As a result, vulnerabilities may be left
    unreported.  This document defines a machine-parsable format ("security.txt")
    to help organizations describe their vulnerability disclosure practices to make
    it easier for researchers to report vulnerabilities.</p>
