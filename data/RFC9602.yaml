abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6) uses IPv6 as the underlying data plane.
    Thus, Segment Identifiers (SIDs) used by SRv6 can resemble IPv6 addresses and
    behave like them while exhibiting slightly different behaviors in some situations.
    This document explores the characteristics of SRv6 SIDs and focuses on the relationship
    of SRv6 SIDs to the IPv6 Addressing Architecture. This document allocates and
    makes a dedicated prefix available for SRv6 SIDs.</p>"
