- content: "<p>This document describes multicast routing architectures that are currently
    deployed on the Internet. This document briefly describes those protocols and
    references their specifications.</p><p>This memo also reclassifies several older
    RFCs to Historic. These RFCs describe multicast routing protocols that were never
    widely deployed or have fallen into disuse. This memo provides information for
    the Internet community.</p>"
