abstract:
- content: <p>This specification defines three types of syndicated Web feeds that
    enable publication of entries across one or more feed documents. This includes
    "paged" feeds for piecemeal access, "archived" feeds that allow reconstruction
    of the feed's contents, and feeds that are explicitly "complete". [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
