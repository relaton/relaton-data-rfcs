abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the functional requirements for a routing protocol
    to be used between autonomous systems.  This document is intended as a necessary
    precursor to the design of a new inter- autonomous system routing protocol and
    specifies requirements for the Internet applicable for use with the current DoD
    IP, the ISO IP, and future Internet Protocols.  It is intended that these requirements
    will form the basis for the future development of a new inter-autonomous systems
    routing architecture and protocol.  This memo does not specify a standard.</p>"
