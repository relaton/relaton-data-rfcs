abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines an extension to the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
    (SMTP) service, which allows an SMTP client to specify (a) that Delivery Status
    Notifications (DSNs) should be generated under certain conditions, (b) whether
    such notifications should return the contents of the message, and (c) additional
    information, to be returned with a DSN, that allows the sender to identify both
    the recipient(s) for which the DSN was issued, and the transaction in which the
    original message was sent. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
