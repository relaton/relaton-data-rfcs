abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines algorithms for Authenticated Encryption with
    Associated Data (AEAD), and defines a uniform interface and a registry for such
    algorithms.  The interface and registry can be used as an application-independent
    set of cryptoalgorithm suites.  This approach provides advantages in efficiency
    and security, and promotes the reuse of crypto implementations. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
