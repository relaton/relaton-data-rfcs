abstract:
- content: "<p>DNS queries and responses are visible to network elements on the path
    between the DNS client and its server. These queries and responses can contain
    privacy-sensitive information, which is valuable to protect.</p><p>This document
    proposes the use of Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) for DNS, to protect
    against passive listeners and certain active attacks. As latency is critical for
    DNS, this proposal also discusses mechanisms to reduce DTLS round trips and reduce
    the DTLS handshake size. The proposed mechanism runs over port 853.</p>"
