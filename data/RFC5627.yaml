abstract:
- content: "<p>Several applications of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) require
    a user agent (UA) to construct and distribute a URI that can be used by anyone
    on the Internet to route a call to that specific UA instance. A URI that routes
    to a specific UA instance is called a Globally Routable UA URI (GRUU). This document
    describes an extension to SIP for obtaining a GRUU from a registrar and for communicating
    a GRUU to a peer within a dialog. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
