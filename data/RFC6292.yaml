abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF intends to provide a new tool to Area Directors for the creation,
    re-chartering, and closing of Working Groups.  The tool will also allow the IETF
    community to view the status of the chartering process.  This document describes
    the requirements for the proposed new tool, and it is intended as input to a later
    activity for the design and development of such a tool.  This document is not
    an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
