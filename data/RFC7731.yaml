abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the Multicast Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy
    Networks (MPL), which provides IPv6 multicast forwarding in constrained networks.
    MPL avoids the need to construct or maintain any multicast forwarding topology,
    disseminating messages to all MPL Forwarders in an MPL Domain.</p><p>MPL has two
    modes of operation. One mode uses the Trickle algorithm to manage control-plane
    and data-plane message transmissions and is applicable for deployments with few
    multicast sources. The other mode uses classic flooding. By providing both modes
    and parameterization of the Trickle algorithm, an MPL implementation can be used
    in a variety of multicast deployments and can trade between dissemination latency
    and transmission efficiency.</p>"
