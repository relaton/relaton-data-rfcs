abstract:
- content: "<p>New protocols or protocol extensions are best designed with due consideration
    of the functionality needed to operate and manage the protocols.  Retrofitting
    operations and management is sub-optimal.  The purpose of this document is to
    provide guidance to authors and reviewers of documents that define new protocols
    or protocol extensions regarding aspects of operations and management that should
    be considered.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
