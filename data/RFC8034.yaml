abstract:
- content: <p>Cable modems based on Data-Over-Cable Service Interface Specifications
    (DOCSIS) provide broadband Internet access to over one hundred million users worldwide.  In
    some cases, the cable modem connection is the bottleneck (lowest speed) link between
    the customer and the Internet.  As a result, the impact of buffering and bufferbloat
    in the cable modem can have a significant effect on user experience.  The CableLabs
    DOCSIS 3.1 specification introduces requirements for cable modems to support an
    Active Queue Management (AQM) algorithm that is intended to alleviate the impact
    that buffering has on latency-sensitive traffic, while preserving bulk throughput
    performance.  In addition, the CableLabs DOCSIS 3.0 specifications have also been
    amended to contain similar requirements.  This document describes the requirements
    on AQM that apply to DOCSIS equipment, including a description of the "DOCSIS-PIE"
    algorithm that is required on DOCSIS 3.1 cable modems.</p>
