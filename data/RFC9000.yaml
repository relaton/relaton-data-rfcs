abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the core of the QUIC transport protocol.  QUIC
    provides applications with flow-controlled streams for structured communication,
    low-latency connection establishment, and network path migration.  QUIC includes
    security measures that ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability in
    a range of deployment circumstances.  Accompanying documents describe the integration
    of TLS for key negotiation, loss detection, and an exemplary congestion control
    algorithm.</p>"
