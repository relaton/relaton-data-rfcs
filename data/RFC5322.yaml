abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies the Internet Message Format (IMF), a syntax
    for text messages that are sent between computer users, within the framework of
    "electronic mail" messages. This specification is a revision of Request For Comments
    (RFC) 2822, which itself superseded Request For Comments (RFC) 822, "Standard
    for the Format of ARPA Internet Text Messages", updating it to reflect current
    practice and incorporating incremental changes that were specified in other RFCs.
