abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes IBM's Shared Memory Communications over RDMA
    (SMC-R) protocol.  This protocol provides Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) communications
    to TCP endpoints in a manner that is transparent to socket applications.  It further
    provides for dynamic discovery of partner RDMA capabilities and dynamic setup
    of RDMA connections, as well as transparent high availability and load balancing
    when redundant RDMA network paths are available.  It maintains many of the traditional
    TCP/IP qualities of service such as filtering that enterprise users demand, as
    well as TCP socket semantics such as urgent data.</p>"
