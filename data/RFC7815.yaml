abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a minimal initiator version of the Internet
    Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) protocol for constrained nodes. IKEv2 is a component
    of IPsec used for performing mutual authentication and establishing and maintaining
    Security Associations (SAs). IKEv2 includes several optional features, which are
    not needed in minimal implementations. This document describes what is required
    from the minimal implementation and also describes various optimizations that
    can be done. The protocol described here is interoperable with a full IKEv2 implementation
    using shared secret authentication (IKEv2 does not require the use of certificate
    authentication). This minimal initiator implementation can only talk to a full
    IKEv2 implementation acting as the responder; thus, two minimal initiator implementations
    cannot talk to each other.</p><p>This document does not update or modify RFC 7296
    but provides a more compact description of the minimal version of the protocol.
    If this document and RFC 7296 conflict, then RFC 7296 is the authoritative description.</p>"
