abstract:
- content: <p>In 2013, after a great deal of community discussion, the decision was
    made to shift from the plain-text, ASCII-only canonical format for RFCs to XML
    as the canonical format with more human-readable formats rendered from that XML.  The
    high-level requirements that informed this change were defined in RFC 6949, "RFC
    Series Format Requirements and Future Development".  Plain text remains an important
    format for many in the IETF community, and it will be one of the publication formats
    rendered from the XML.  This document outlines the rendering requirements for
    the plain-text RFC publication format.  These requirements do not apply to plain-text
    RFCs published before the format transition.</p>
