abstract:
- content: "<p>The RADIUS protocol defined in RFC 2865 has limited support for authentication
    and encryption of RADIUS packets.  The protocol transports data in the clear,
    although some parts of the packets can have obfuscated content.  Packets may be
    replayed verbatim by an attacker, and client-server authentication is based on
    fixed shared secrets.  This document specifies how the Datagram Transport Layer
    Security (DTLS) protocol may be used as a fix for these problems.  It also describes
    how implementations of this proposal can coexist with current RADIUS systems.</p>"
