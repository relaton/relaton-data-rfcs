abstract:
- content: "<p>Power Line Communication (PLC), namely using electric power lines for
    indoor and outdoor communications, has been widely applied to support Advanced
    Metering Infrastructure (AMI), especially smart meters for electricity.  The existing
    electricity infrastructure facilitates the expansion of PLC deployments due to
    its potential advantages in terms of cost and convenience.  Moreover, a wide variety
    of accessible devices raises the potential demand of IPv6 for future applications.
    \ This document describes how IPv6 packets are transported over constrained PLC
    networks, such as those described in ITU-T G.9903, IEEE 1901.1, and IEEE 1901.2.</p>"
