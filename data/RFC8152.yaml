abstract:
- content: "<p>Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) is a data format designed
    for small code size and small message size.  There is a need for the ability to
    have basic security services defined for this data format.  This document defines
    the CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) protocol.  This specification describes
    how to create and process signatures, message authentication codes, and encryption
    using CBOR for serialization.  This specification additionally describes how to
    represent cryptographic keys using CBOR.</p>"
