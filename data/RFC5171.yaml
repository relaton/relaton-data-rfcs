abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a Cisco Systems protocol that can be used to
    detect and disable unidirectional Ethernet fiber or copper links caused, for instance,
    by mis-wiring of fiber strands, interface malfunctions, media converters' faults,
    etc. It operates at Layer 2 in conjunction with IEEE 802.3's existing Layer 1
    fault detection mechanisms.</p><p>This document explains the protocol objectives
    and applications, illustrates the specific premises the protocol was based upon,
    and describes the protocol architecture and related deployment issues to serve
    as a possible base for future standardization. This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.</p>"
