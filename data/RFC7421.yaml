abstract:
- content: "<p>The IPv6 unicast addressing format includes a separation between the
    prefix used to route packets to a subnet and the interface identifier used to
    specify a given interface connected to that subnet.  Currently, the interface
    identifier is defined as 64 bits long for almost every case, leaving 64 bits for
    the subnet prefix.  This document describes the advantages of this fixed boundary
    and analyzes the issues that would be involved in treating it as a variable boundary.</p>"
