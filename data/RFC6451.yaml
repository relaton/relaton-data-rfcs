abstract:
- content: <p>An important class of location-based services answers the question,
    "What instances of this service are closest to me?" Examples include finding restaurants,
    gas stations, stores, automated teller machines, wireless access points (hot spots),
    or parking spaces.  Currently, the Location-to-Service Translation (LoST) protocol
    only supports mapping locations to a single service based on service regions.  This
    document describes an extension that allows queries of the type "N nearest", "within
    distance X", and "served by".  This document defines an Experimental Protocol
    for the Internet community.</p>
