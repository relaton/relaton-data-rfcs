abstract:
- content: "<p>In multimedia communications, presence, and instant messaging systems,
    there is a need to define Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) that represent services
    that are associated with a group of users. One example is a resource list service.
    If a user sends a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) SUBSCRIBE message to the URI
    representing the resource list service, the server will obtain the state of the
    users in the associated group, and provide it to the sender. To facilitate definition
    of these services, this specification defines two Extensible Markup Language (XML)
    documents. One document contains service URIs, along with their service definition
    and a reference to the associated group of users. The second document contains
    the user lists that are referenced from the first. This list of users can be utilized
    by other applications and services. Both documents can be created and managed
    with the XML Configuration Access Protocol (XCAP). [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
