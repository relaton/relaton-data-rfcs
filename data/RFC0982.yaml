abstract:
- content: <p>This RFC is a draft working document of the ANSI "Guidelines for the
    Specification of the Structure of the Domain Specific Part (DSP) of the ISO Standard
    NSAP Address".  It provides guidance to private address administration authorities
    on preferred formats and semantics for the Domain Specific Part (DSP) of an NSAP
    address.  This RFC specifies the way in which the DSP may be constructed so as
    to facilitate efficient address assignment.  This RFC is for informational purposes
    only and its distribution is unlimited and does not specify a standard of the
    ARPA-Internet.</p>
