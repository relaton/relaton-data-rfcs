abstract:
- content: "<p>The X.500 Directory uses distinguished names (DNs) as primary keys
    to entries in the directory.  This document defines the string representation
    used in the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) to transfer distinguished
    names.  The string representation is designed to give a clean representation of
    commonly used distinguished names, while being able to represent any distinguished
    name. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
