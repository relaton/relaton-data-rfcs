abstract:
- content: <p>The Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) (RFC 5730) defines the use
    of authorization information to authorize a transfer of an EPP object, such as
    a domain name, between clients that are referred to as "registrars".  Object-specific,
    password-based authorization information (see RFCs 5731 and 5733) is commonly
    used but raises issues related to the security, complexity, storage, and lifetime
    of authentication information.  This document defines an operational practice,
    using the EPP RFCs, that leverages the use of strong random authorization information
    values that are short lived, not stored by the client, and stored by the server
    using a cryptographic hash that provides for secure authorization information
    that can safely be used for object transfers.</p>
