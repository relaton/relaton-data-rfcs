abstract:
- content: <p>Hosts in an IP network are identified by IP addresses, and the IP address
    prefixes of subnets are advertised by routing protocols.  A change in such IP
    addressing information associated with a host or subnet is known as "renumbering".  This
    memo provides information for the Internet community.  This memo does not specify
    an Internet standard of any kind.</p>
