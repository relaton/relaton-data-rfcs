abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a new report block type within the framework
    of RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Extended Reports (XRs).  One of the initial XR
    report block types is the Loss Run Length Encoding (RLE) Report Block.  This report
    conveys information regarding the individual Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP)
    packet receipt and loss events experienced during the RTCP interval preceding
    the transmission of the report.  The new report, which is referred to as the Post-repair
    Loss RLE report, carries information regarding the packets that remain lost after
    all loss-repair methods are applied.  By comparing the RTP packet receipts/losses
    before and after the loss repair is completed, one can determine the effectiveness
    of the loss- repair methods in an aggregated fashion.  This document also defines
    the signaling of the Post-repair Loss RLE report in the Session Description Protocol
    (SDP). [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
