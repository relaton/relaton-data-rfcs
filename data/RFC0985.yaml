abstract:
- content: "<p>This RFC summarizes the requirements for gateways to be used on networks
    supporting the DARPA Internet protocols.  While it applies specifically to National
    Science Foundation research programs, the requirements are stated in a general
    context and are believed applicable throughout the Internet community.  The purpose
    of this document is to present guidance for vendors offering products that might
    be used or adapted for use in an Internet application.  It enumerates the protocols
    required and gives references to RFCs and other documents describing the current
    specification.</p>"
