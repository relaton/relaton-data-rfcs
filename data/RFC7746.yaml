abstract:
- content: "<p>When certain RSVP-TE optimizations are implemented, ingress Label Switching
    Router (LSRs) can receive RSVP RESV messages before forwarding state has been
    installed on all downstream nodes. According to the RSVP-TE specification, the
    ingress LSR can forward traffic through a Label Switched Path (LSP) as soon as
    it receives a RESV message. However, if the ingress LSR forwards traffic through
    the LSP before forwarding state has been installed on all downstream nodes, traffic
    can be lost.</p><p>This document describes LSP Self-ping. When an ingress LSR
    receives an RESV message, it can invoke LSP Self-ping procedures to ensure that
    forwarding state has been installed on all downstream nodes.</p><p>LSP Self-ping
    is a new protocol. It is not an extension of LSP Ping. Although LSP Ping and LSP
    Self-ping are named similarly, each is designed for a unique purpose. Each protocol
    listens on its own UDP port and executes its own procedures.</p><p>LSP Self-ping
    is an extremely lightweight mechanism. It does not consume control-plane resources
    on transit or egress LSRs.</p>"
