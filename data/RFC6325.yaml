abstract:
- content: "<p>Routing Bridges (RBridges) provide optimal pair-wise forwarding without
    configuration, safe forwarding even during periods of temporary loops, and support
    for multipathing of both unicast and multicast traffic. They achieve these goals
    using IS-IS routing and encapsulation of traffic with a header that includes a
    hop count.</p><p>RBridges are compatible with previous IEEE 802.1 customer bridges
    as well as IPv4 and IPv6 routers and end nodes. They are as invisible to current
    IP routers as bridges are and, like routers, they terminate the bridge spanning
    tree protocol.</p><p>The design supports VLANs and the optimization of the distribution
    of multi-destination frames based on VLAN ID and based on IP-derived multicast
    groups. It also allows unicast forwarding tables at transit RBridges to be sized
    according to the number of RBridges (rather than the number of end nodes), which
    allows their forwarding tables to be substantially smaller than in conventional
    customer bridges. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
