abstract:
- content: "<p>This document lists a set of functional requirements that served as
    input to the design of Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) extensions for setting
    up point-to-multipoint (P2MP) Label Switched Paths (LSP), in order to deliver
    point-to-multipoint applications over a Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) infrastructure.</p><p>This
    work was overtaken by the protocol solution developed by the MPLS working group,
    but that solution did not closely follow the requirements documented here. This
    document is published as a historic record of the ideas and requirements that
    shaped the protocol work. This document defines a Historic Document for the Internet
    community.</p>"
