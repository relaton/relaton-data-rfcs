abstract:
- content: <p>In the original version of the Internationalized Domain Names in Applications
    (IDNA) protocol, any Unicode code points taken from user input were mapped into
    a set of Unicode code points that "made sense", and then encoded and passed to
    the domain name system (DNS).  The IDNA2008 protocol (described in RFCs 5890,
    5891, 5892, and 5893) presumes that the input to the protocol comes from a set
    of "permitted" code points, which it then encodes and passes to the DNS, but does
    not specify what to do with the result of user input.  This document describes
    the actions that can be taken by an implementation between receiving user input
    and passing permitted code points to the new IDNA protocol.  This document is
    not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational
    purposes.</p>
