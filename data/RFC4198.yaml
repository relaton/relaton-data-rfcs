abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a URN (Uniform Resource Name) namespace for
    identifying content resources within federated content collections. A federated
    content collection often does not have a strong centralized authority but relies
    upon shared naming, metadata, and access conventions to provide interoperability
    among its members. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
