abstract:
- content: "<p>The Eifel detection algorithm allows a TCP sender to detect a posteriori
    whether it has entered loss recovery unnecessarily.  It requires that the TCP
    Timestamps option defined in RFC 1323 be enabled for a connection.  The Eifel
    detection algorithm makes use of the fact that the TCP Timestamps option eliminates
    the retransmission ambiguity in TCP.  Based on the timestamp of the first acceptable
    ACK that arrives during loss recovery, it decides whether loss recovery was entered
    unnecessarily.  The Eifel detection algorithm provides a basis for future TCP
    enhancements.  This includes response algorithms to back out of loss recovery
    by restoring a TCP sender's congestion control state.  This memo defines an Experimental
    Protocol for the Internet community.</p>"
