abstract:
- content: "<p>Distributed Mobility Management solutions allow networks to be set
    up in such a way that traffic is distributed optimally and centrally deployed
    anchors are not relied upon to provide IP mobility support.</p><p>There are many
    different approaches to address Distributed Mobility Management -- for example,
    extending network-based mobility protocols (like Proxy Mobile IPv6) or client-based
    mobility protocols (like Mobile IPv6), among others. This document follows the
    former approach and proposes a solution based on Proxy Mobile IPv6, in which mobility
    sessions are anchored at the last IP hop router (called the mobility anchor and
    access router). The mobility anchor and access router is an enhanced access router
    that is also able to operate as a local mobility anchor or mobility access gateway
    on a per-prefix basis. The document focuses on the required extensions to effectively
    support the simultaneous anchoring several flows at different distributed gateways.</p>"
