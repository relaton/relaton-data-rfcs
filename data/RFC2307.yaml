    related to TCP/IP and the UNIX system into X.500 entries so that they may be resolved
    with the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol [RFC2251].  This memo defines an
    Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.  It does not specify an Internet
    standard of any kind.  Discussion and suggestions for improvement are requested.</p>"
