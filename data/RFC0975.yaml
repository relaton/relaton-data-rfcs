abstract:
- content: "<p>This RFC proposes enhancements to the Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP)
    to support a simple, multiple-level routing capability while preserving the robustness
    features of the current EGP model.  The enhancements generalize the concept of
    core system to include multiple communities of autonomous systems, called autonomous
    confederations.  Discussion and suggestions for improvement are requested.</p>"
