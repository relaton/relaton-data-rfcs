abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an updated version of the Encapsulating Security
    Payload (ESP) protocol, which is designed to provide a mix of security services
    in IPv4 and IPv6.  ESP is used to provide confidentiality, data origin authentication,
    connectionless integrity, an anti-replay service (a form of partial sequence integrity),
    and limited traffic flow confidentiality.  This document obsoletes RFC 2406 (November
    1998). [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
