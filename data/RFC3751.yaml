abstract:
- content: "<p>There have been a number of legislative initiatives in the U.S.  and
    elsewhere over the past few years to use the Internet to actively interfere with
    allegedly illegal activities of Internet users.  This memo proposes a number of
    requirements for a new protocol, the Omniscience Protocol, that could be used
    to enable such efforts.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
