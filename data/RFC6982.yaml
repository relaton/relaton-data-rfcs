abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a simple process that allows authors of Internet-Drafts
    to record the status of known implementations by including an Implementation Status
    section. This will allow reviewers and working groups to assign due consideration
    to documents that have the benefit of running code, which may serve as evidence
    of valuable experimentation and feedback that have made the implemented protocols
    more mature.</p><p>The process in this document is offered as an experiment. Authors
    of Internet-Drafts are encouraged to consider using the process for their documents,
    and working groups are invited to think about applying the process to all of their
    protocol specifications. The authors of this document intend to collate experiences
    with this experiment and to report them to the community.</p>"
