abstract:
- content: "<p>The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is widely deployed to
    monitor, control, and (sometimes also) configure network elements. Even though
    the SNMP technology is well documented, it remains relatively unclear how SNMP
    is used in practice and what typical SNMP usage patterns are.</p><p>This document
    describes an approach to carrying out large-scale SNMP traffic measurements in
    order to develop a better understanding of how SNMP is used in real-world production
    networks. It describes the motivation, the measurement approach, and the tools
    and data formats needed to carry out such a study.</p><p>This document was produced
    within the IRTF's Network Management Research Group (NMRG), and it represents
    the consensus of all of the active contributors to this group. This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.</p>"
