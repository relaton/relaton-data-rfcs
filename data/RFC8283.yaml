abstract:
- content: "<p>The Path Computation Element (PCE) is a core component of Software-
    Defined Networking (SDN) systems. It can compute optimal paths for traffic across
    a network and can also update the paths to reflect changes in the network or traffic
    demands.</p><p>PCE was developed to derive paths for MPLS Label Switched Paths
    (LSPs), which are supplied to the head end of the LSP using the Path Computation
    Element Communication Protocol (PCEP).</p><p>SDN has a broader applicability than
    signaled MPLS traffic-engineered (TE) networks, and the PCE may be used to determine
    paths in a range of use cases including static LSPs, segment routing, Service
    Function Chaining (SFC), and most forms of a routed or switched network. It is,
    therefore, reasonable to consider PCEP as a control protocol for use in these
    environments to allow the PCE to be fully enabled as a central controller.</p><p>This
    document briefly introduces the architecture for PCE as a central controller,
    examines the motivations and applicability for PCEP as a control protocol in this
    environment, and introduces the implications for the protocol. A PCE-based central
    controller can simplify the processing of a distributed control plane by blending
    it with elements of SDN and without necessarily completely replacing it.</p><p>This
    document does not describe use cases in detail and does not define protocol extensions:
    that work is left for other documents.</p>"
