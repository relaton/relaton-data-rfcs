abstract:
- content: "<p>To support the activities of the Federal Research Internet Coordinating
    Committee (FRICC) in creating an interconnected set of networks to serve the research
    community, two workshops were held to address the technical support of policy
    issues that arise when interconnecting such networks. Held under the suspices
    of the Internet Activities Board at the request of the FRICC, and sponsored by
    NASA through RIACS, the workshops addressed the required and feasible technologies
    and architectures that could be used to satisfy the desired policies for interconnection.
    The purpose of this RFC is to report the results of these workshops.</p>"
