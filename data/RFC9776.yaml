abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) is the protocol used
    by IPv4 systems to report their IP multicast group memberships to neighboring
    multicast routers. Version 3 of IGMP (IGMPv3) adds support for source filtering,
    that is, the ability for a system to report interest in receiving packets only
    from specific source addresses, or from all but specific source addresses, sent
    to a particular multicast address. That information may be used by multicast routing
    protocols to avoid delivering multicast packets from specific sources to networks
    where there are no interested receivers.</p><p>This document specifies IGMPv3.
    It is a revised version of RFC 3376 that includes clarifications and fixes for
    errata, and it is backward compatible with RFC 3376.</p><p>This document updates
    RFC 2236 and obsoletes RFC 3376.</p>"
