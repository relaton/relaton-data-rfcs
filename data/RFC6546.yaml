    XML format for document exchange, and Real-time Inter-network Defense (RID) defines
    extensions to IODEF intended for the cooperative handling of security incidents
    within consortia of network operators and enterprises.  This document specifies
    an application-layer protocol for RID based upon the passing of RID messages over
    HTTP/TLS. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
