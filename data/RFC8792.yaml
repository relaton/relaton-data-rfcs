abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines two strategies for handling long lines in width-bounded
    text content.  One strategy, called the "single backslash" strategy, is based
    on the historical use of a single backslash ('\') character to indicate where
    line-folding has occurred, with the continuation occurring with the first character
    that is not a space character (' ') on the next line.  The second strategy, called
    the "double backslash" strategy, extends the first strategy by adding a second
    backslash character to identify where the continuation begins and is thereby able
    to handle cases not supported by the first strategy.  Both strategies use a self-describing
    header enabling automated reconstitution of the original content.</p>
