abstract:
- content: '<p>This document describes a specification for taking Uniform Resource
    Identifiers (URI) and locating an authoritative server for information about that
    URI.  The method used to locate that authoritative server is the Dynamic Delegation
    Discovery System.  This document is part of a series that is specified in "Dynamic
    Delegation Discovery System (DDDS) Part One: The Comprehensive DDDS" (RFC 3401).  It
    is very important to note that it is impossible to read and understand any document
    in this series without reading the others. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>'
