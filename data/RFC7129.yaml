abstract:
- content: "<p>Authenticated denial of existence allows a resolver to validate that
    a certain domain name does not exist. It is also used to signal that a domain
    name exists but does not have the specific resource record (RR) type you were
    asking for. When returning a negative DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) response,
    a name server usually includes up to two NSEC records. With NSEC version 3 (NSEC3),
    this amount is three.</p><p>This document provides additional background commentary
    and some context for the NSEC and NSEC3 mechanisms used by DNSSEC to provide authenticated
    denial-of-existence responses.</p>"
