abstract:
- content: "<p>The Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) constructs
    routes by using Objective Functions that optimize or constrain the routes it selects
    and uses.  This specification describes the Minimum Rank with Hysteresis Objective
    Function (MRHOF), an Objective Function that selects routes that minimize a metric,
    while using hysteresis to reduce churn in response to small metric changes.  MRHOF
    works with additive metrics along a route, and the metrics it uses are determined
    by the metrics that the RPL Destination Information Object (DIO) messages advertise.
