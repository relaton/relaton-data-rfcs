abstract:
- content: "<p>Aggregate Server Access Protocol (ASAP; RFC 5352), in conjunction with
    the Endpoint Handlespace Redundancy Protocol (ENRP; RFC 5353), provides a high-availability
    data transfer mechanism over IP networks. ASAP uses a handle-based addressing
    model that isolates a logical communication endpoint from its IP address(es),
    thus effectively eliminating the binding between the communication endpoint and
    its physical IP address(es), which normally constitutes a single point of failure.</p><p>In
    addition, ASAP defines each logical communication destination as a pool, providing
    full transparent support for server pooling and load sharing. It also allows dynamic
    system scalability -- members of a server pool can be added or removed at any
    time without interrupting the service.</p><p>ASAP is designed to take full advantage
    of the network level redundancy provided by the Stream Transmission Control Protocol
    (SCTP; RFC 4960). Each transport protocol, other than SCTP, MUST have an accompanying
    transport mapping document. It should be noted that ASAP messages passed between
    Pool Elements (PEs) and ENRP servers MUST use the SCTP transport protocol.</p><p>The
    high-availability server pooling is gained by combining two protocols, namely
    ASAP and ENRP, in which ASAP provides the user interface for Pool Handle to address
    translation, load sharing management, and fault management, while ENRP defines
    the high- availability Pool Handle translation service. This memo defines an Experimental
    Protocol for the Internet community.</p>"
