abstract:
- content: <p>While the Internet Key Exchange Protocol version 2 (IKEv2) supports
    public key based authentication, the corresponding use of in-band Certificate
    Revocation Lists (CRL) is problematic due to unbounded CRL size. The size of an
    Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) response is however well-bounded and
    small. This document defines the "OCSP Content" extension to IKEv2. A CERTREQ
    payload with "OCSP Content" identifies zero or more trusted OCSP responders and
    is a request for inclusion of an OCSP response in the IKEv2 handshake. A cooperative
    recipient of such a request responds with a CERT payload containing the appropriate
    OCSP response. This content is recognizable via the same "OCSP Content" identifier.</p><p>When
    certificates are used with IKEv2, the communicating peers need a mechanism to
    determine the revocation status of the peer's certificate. OCSP is one such mechanism.
    This document applies when OCSP is desired and security policy prevents one of
    the IKEv2 peers from accessing the relevant OCSP responder directly. Firewalls
    are often deployed in a manner that prevents such access by IKEv2 peers outside
    of an enterprise network. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
