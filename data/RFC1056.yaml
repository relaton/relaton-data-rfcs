abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo is a discussion of the Pcmail workstation based distributed
    mail system.  It is identical to the discussion in RFC-993, save that a new, much
    simpler mail transport protocol is described.  The new transport protocol is the
    result of continued research into ease of protocol implementation and use issues.</p>"
