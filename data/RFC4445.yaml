abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines a Media Delivery Index (MDI) measurement that can
    be used as a diagnostic tool or a quality indicator for monitoring a network intended
    to deliver applications such as streaming media, MPEG video, Voice over IP, or
    other information sensitive to arrival time and packet loss.  It provides an indication
    of traffic jitter, a measure of deviation from nominal flow rates, and a data
    loss at-a-glance measure for a particular flow.  For instance, the MDI may be
    used as a reference in characterizing and comparing networks carrying UDP streaming
    media.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
