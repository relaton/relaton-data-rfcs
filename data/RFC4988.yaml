abstract:
- content: "<p>This document adapts the Mobile IPv6 Fast Handovers to improve delay
    and packet loss resulting from Mobile IPv4 handover operations.  Specifically,
    this document addresses movement detection, IP address configuration, and location
    update latencies during a handover.  For reducing the IP address configuration
    latency, the document proposes that the new Care-of Address is always made to
    be the new access router's IP address.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol
    for the Internet community.</p>"
