abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the changes between Unicode 6.0.0 and Unicode
    12.0.0 in the context of the current version of Internationalized Domain Names
    for Applications 2008 (IDNA2008). Some additions and changes have been made in
    the Unicode Standard that affect the values produced by the algorithm IDNA2008
    specifies. IDNA2008 allows adding exceptions to the algorithm for backward compatibility;
    however, this document does not add any such exceptions. This document provides
    the necessary tables to IANA to make its database consistent with Unicode 12.0.0.</p><p>To
    improve understanding, this document describes systems that are being used as
    alternatives to those that conform to IDNA2008.</p>"
