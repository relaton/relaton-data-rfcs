abstract:
- content: "<p>This document aims to clarify terms and concepts presented in RFC 3095.
    \ RFC 3095 defines a Proposed Standard framework with profiles for RObust Header
    Compression (ROHC).  The standard introduces various concepts which might be difficult
    to understand and especially to relate correctly to the surrounding environments
    where header compression may be used.  This document aims at clarifying these
    aspects of ROHC, discussing terms such as ROHC instances, ROHC channels, ROHC
    feedback, and ROHC contexts, and how these terms relate to other terms, like network
    elements and IP interfaces, commonly used, for example, when addressing MIB issues.
    \ This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
