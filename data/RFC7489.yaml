abstract:
- content: "<p>Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC)
    is a scalable mechanism by which a mail-originating organization can express domain-level
    policies and preferences for message validation, disposition, and reporting, that
    a mail-receiving organization can use to improve mail handling.</p><p>Originators
    of Internet Mail need to be able to associate reliable and authenticated domain
    identifiers with messages, communicate policies about messages that use those
    identifiers, and report about mail using those identifiers. These abilities have
    several benefits: Receivers can provide feedback to Domain Owners about the use
    of their domains; this feedback can provide valuable insight about the management
    of internal operations and the presence of external domain name abuse.</p><p>DMARC
    does not produce or encourage elevated delivery privilege of authenticated email.
    DMARC is a mechanism for policy distribution that enables increasingly strict
    handling of messages that fail authentication checks, ranging from no action,
    through altered delivery, up to message rejection.</p>"
