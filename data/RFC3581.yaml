abstract:
- content: <p>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) operates over UDP and TCP, among
    others.  When used with UDP, responses to requests are returned to the source
    address the request came from, and to the port written into the topmost Via header
    field value of the request.  This behavior is not desirable in many cases, most
    notably, when the client is behind a Network Address Translator (NAT).  This extension
    defines a new parameter for the Via header field, called "rport", that allows
    a client to request that the server send the response back to the source IP address
    and port from which the request originated. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
