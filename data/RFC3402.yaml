abstract:
- content: '<p>This document describes the Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS)
    algorithm for applying dynamically retrieved string transformation rules to an
    application-unique string. Well-formed transformation rules will reflect the delegation
    of management of information associated with the string. This document is also
    part of a series that is completely specified in "Dynamic Delegation Discovery
    System (DDDS) Part One: The Comprehensive DDDS" (RFC 3401). It is very important
    to note that it is impossible to read and understand any document in this series
    without reading the others. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>'
