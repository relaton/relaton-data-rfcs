abstract:
- content: "<p>The Path Computation Element (PCE) architecture is set out in RFC 4655.
    The architecture is extended for multi-layer networking with the introduction
    of the Virtual Network Topology Manager (VNTM) in RFC 5623 and generalized to
    Hierarchical PCE (H-PCE) in RFC 6805.</p><p>These three architectural views of
    PCE deliberately leave some key questions unanswered, especially with respect
    to the interactions between architectural components. This document draws out
    those questions and discusses them in an architectural context with reference
    to other architectural components, existing protocols, and recent IETF efforts.</p><p>This
    document does not update the architecture documents and does not define how protocols
    or components must be used. It does, however, suggest how the architectural components
    might be combined to provide advanced PCE function.</p>"
