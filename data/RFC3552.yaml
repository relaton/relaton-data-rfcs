abstract:
- content: "<p>All RFCs are required to have a Security Considerations section.  Historically,
    such sections have been relatively weak.  This document provides guidelines to
    RFC authors on how to write a good Security Considerations section.  This document
    specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests
    discussion and suggestions for improvements.</p>"
