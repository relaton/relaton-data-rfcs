abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes an RTP Payload format for the ITU-T Recommendation
    H.264 video codec and the technically identical ISO/IEC International Standard
    14496-10 video codec, excluding the Scalable Video Coding (SVC) extension and
    the Multiview Video Coding extension, for which the RTP payload formats are defined
    elsewhere. The RTP payload format allows for packetization of one or more Network
    Abstraction Layer Units (NALUs), produced by an H.264 video encoder, in each RTP
    payload. The payload format has wide applicability, as it supports applications
    from simple low bitrate conversational usage, to Internet video streaming with
    interleaved transmission, to high bitrate video-on-demand.</p><p>This memo obsoletes
    RFC 3984. Changes from RFC 3984 are summarized in Section 14. Issues on backward
    compatibility to RFC 3984 are discussed in Section 15. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
