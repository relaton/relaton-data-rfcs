abstract:
- content: "<p>Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) algorithms provide
    both confidentiality and integrity of data. The widespread use of AEAD algorithms
    in various applications has led to an increased demand for AEAD algorithms with
    additional properties, driving research in the field. This document provides definitions
    for the most common of those properties and aims to improve consistency in the
    terminology used in documentation. This document is a product of the Crypto Forum
    Research Group.</p>"
