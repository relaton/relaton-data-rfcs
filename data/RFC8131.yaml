abstract:
- content: "<p>In non-packet transport networks, there are requirements where the
    Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) end-to-end recovery scheme needs
    to employ a restoration Label Switched Path (LSP) while keeping resources for
    the working and/or protecting LSPs reserved in the network after the failure occurs.</p><p>This
    document reviews how the LSP association is to be provided using Resource Reservation
    Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) signaling in the context of a GMPLS end-to-end
    recovery scheme when using restoration LSP where failed LSP is not torn down.
    In addition, this document discusses resource sharing-based setup and teardown
    of LSPs as well as LSP reversion procedures. No new signaling extensions are defined
    by this document, and it is strictly informative in nature.</p>"
