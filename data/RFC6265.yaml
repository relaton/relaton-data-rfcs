abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the HTTP Cookie and Set-Cookie header fields.
    \ These header fields can be used by HTTP servers to store state (called cookies)
    at HTTP user agents, letting the servers maintain a stateful session over the
    mostly stateless HTTP protocol.  Although cookies have many historical infelicities
    that degrade their security and privacy, the Cookie and Set-Cookie header fields
    are widely used on the Internet.  This document obsoletes RFC 2965. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
