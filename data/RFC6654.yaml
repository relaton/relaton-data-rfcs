abstract:
- content: <p>This document proposes an alternative IPv6 Rapid Deployment on IPv4
    Infrastructures (6rd) deployment model to that of RFC 5969.  The basic 6rd model
    allows IPv6 hosts to gain access to IPv6 networks across an IPv4 access network
    using 6-in-4 tunnels.  6rd requires support by a device (the 6rd customer edge,
    or 6rd-CE) on the customer site, which must also be assigned an IPv4 address.  The
    alternative model described in this document initiates the 6-in-4 tunnels from
    an operator-owned Gateway collocated with the operator's IPv4 network edge rather
    than from customer equipment, and hence is termed "Gateway-initiated 6rd" (GI
    6rd).  The advantages of this approach are that it requires no modification to
    customer equipment and avoids assignment of IPv4 addresses to customer equipment.  The
    latter point means less pressure on IPv4 addresses in a high-growth environment.  This
    document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for
    informational purposes.</p>
