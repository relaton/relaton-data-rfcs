abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
    for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-based internets. In particular,
    it defines two MIB modules for managing the capabilities of MAC bridges defined
    by the IEEE 802.1D-1998 (TM) MAC Bridges and the IEEE 802.1Q-2003 (TM) Virtual
    LAN (VLAN) standards for bridging between Local Area Network (LAN) segments. One
    MIB module defines objects for managing the 'Traffic Classes' and 'Enhanced Multicast
    Filtering' components of IEEE 802.1D-1998 and P802.1t-2001 (TM). The other MIB
    module defines objects for managing VLANs, as specified in IEEE 802.1Q-2003, P802.1u
    (TM), and P802.1v (TM).</p><p>Provisions are made for support of transparent bridging.
    Provisions are also made so that these objects apply to bridges connected by subnetworks
    other than LAN segments.</p><p>This memo supplements RFC 4188 and obsoletes RFC
    2674. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
