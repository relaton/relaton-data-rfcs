abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is a description of, and a specification for, the NETBLT
    protocol.  It is a revision of the specification published in RFC-969.  NETBLT
    (NETwork BLock Transfer) is a transport level protocol intended for the rapid
    transfer of a large quantity of data between computers.  It provides a transfer
    that is reliable and flow controlled, and is designed to provide maximum throughput
    over a wide variety of networks.  Although NETBLT currently runs on top of the
    Internet Protocol (IP), it should be able to operate on top of any datagram protocol
    similar in function to IP.  This document is published for discussion and comment,
    and does not constitute a standard.  The proposal may change and certain parts
    of the protocol have not yet been specified; implementation of this document is
    therefore not advised.  Obsoletes RFC-969.</p>"
