abstract:
- content: "<p>The Centralized Conferencing Manipulation Protocol (CCMP) allows a
    Centralized Conferencing (XCON) system client to create, retrieve, change, and
    delete objects that describe a centralized conference.  CCMP is a means to control
    basic and advanced conference features such as conference state and capabilities,
    participants, relative roles, and details.  CCMP is a stateless, XML-based, client
    server protocol that carries, in its request and response messages, conference
    information in the form of XML documents and fragments conforming to the centralized
    conferencing data model schema. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
