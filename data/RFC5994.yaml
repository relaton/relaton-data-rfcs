abstract:
- content: "<p>Ethernet pseudowires are widely deployed to support packet transport
    of Ethernet services. These services in-turn provide transport for a variety of
    client networks, e.g., IP and MPLS. This document uses procedures defined in the
    existing IETF specifications of Ethernet pseudowires carried over MPLS networks.</p><p>Many
    of the requirements for the services provided by the mechanisms explained in this
    document are also recognized by the MPLS transport profile (MPLS-TP) design effort
    formed jointly by the IETF and ITU-T. The solution described here does not address
    all of the MPLS-TP requirements, but it provides a viable form of packet transport
    service using tools that are already available.</p><p>This document also serves
    as an indication that existing MPLS techniques form an appropriate basis for the
    design of a fully- featured packet transport solution addressing all of the requirements
    of MPLS-TP. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it
    is published for informational purposes.</p>"
