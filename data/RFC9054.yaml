abstract:
- content: "<p>The CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) syntax (see RFC 9052)
    does not define any direct methods for using hash algorithms.  There are, however,
    circumstances where hash algorithms are used, such as indirect signatures, where
    the hash of one or more contents are signed, and identification of an X.509 certificate
    or other object by the use of a fingerprint.  This document defines hash algorithms
    that are identified by COSE algorithm identifiers.</p>"
