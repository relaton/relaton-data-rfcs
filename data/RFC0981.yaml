abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces wiretap algorithms, a class of experimental,
    multiple routing algorithms that compute quasi-optimum routes for stations sharing
    a packet-radio broadcast channel. The primary route (a minimum-distance path),
    and additional paths ordered by distance, which serve as alternate routes should
    the primary route fail, are computed. This prototype is presented as an example
    of a class of routing algorithms and data-base management techniques that may
    find wider application in the Internet community. Discussions and suggestions
    for improvements are welcomed.</p>"
