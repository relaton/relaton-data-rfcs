abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a summary of Request-Routing techniques that
    are used to direct client requests to surrogates based on various policies and
    a possible set of metrics. The document covers techniques that were commonly used
    in the industry on or before December 2000. In this memo, the term Request-Routing
    represents techniques that is commonly called content routing or content redirection.
    In principle, Request-Routing techniques can be classified under: DNS Request-Routing,
    Transport-layer Request-Routing, and Application-layer Request-Routing. This memo
    provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
