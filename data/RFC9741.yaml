abstract:
- content: <p>The Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL), standardized in RFC 8610,
    provides "control operators" as its main language extension point. RFCs have added
    to this extension point in both an application-specific and a more general way.</p><p>The
    present document defines a number of additional generally applicable control operators
    for text conversion (bytes, integers, printf-style formatting, and JSON) and for
    an operation on text.</p>
