abstract:
- content: "<p>A common design pattern in Internet of Things (IoT) deployments is
    the use of a constrained device that collects data via sensors or controls actuators
    for use in home automation, industrial control systems, smart cities, and other
    IoT deployments.</p><p>This document defines a Transport Layer Security (TLS)
    and Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) 1.2 profile that offers communications
    security for this data exchange thereby preventing eavesdropping, tampering, and
    message forgery. The lack of communication security is a common vulnerability
    in IoT products that can easily be solved by using these well-researched and widely
    deployed Internet security protocols.</p>"
