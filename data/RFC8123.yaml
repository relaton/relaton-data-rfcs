abstract:
- content: "<p>SIP networks use signaling monitoring tools to debug customer- reported
    problems and for regression testing if network or client software is upgraded.
    As networks grow and become interconnected, including connection via transit networks,
    it becomes impractical to predict the path that SIP signaling will take between
    clients and, therefore, impractical to monitor SIP signaling end-to-end.</p><p>This
    document describes the requirements for adding an indicator to the SIP Protocol
    Data Unit (PDU) or a SIP message that marks the PDU as a candidate for logging.
    Such a marking will typically be applied as part of network testing controlled
    by the network operator and not used in regular client signaling. However, such
    a marking can be carried end-to-end, including the SIP terminals, even if a session
    originates and terminates in different networks.</p>"
