abstract:
- content: "<p>Over the past decade, Voice over IP (VoIP) systems based on SIP have
    replaced many traditional telephony deployments.  Interworking VoIP systems with
    the traditional telephone network has reduced the overall level of calling party
    number and Caller ID assurances by granting attackers new and inexpensive tools
    to impersonate or obscure calling party numbers when orchestrating bulk commercial
    calling schemes, hacking voicemail boxes, or even circumventing multi-factor authentication
    systems trusted by banks.  Despite previous attempts to provide a secure assurance
    of the origin of SIP communications, we still lack effective standards for identifying
    the calling party in a VoIP session.  This document examines the reasons why providing
    identity for telephone numbers on the Internet has proven so difficult and shows
    how changes in the last decade may provide us with new strategies for attaching
    a secure identity to SIP sessions.  It also gives high-level requirements for
    a solution in this space.</p>"
