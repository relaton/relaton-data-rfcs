abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a protocol for asking an IPv6 node to supply
    certain network information, such as its hostname or fully-qualified domain name.
    \ IPv6 implementation experience has shown that direct queries for a hostname
    are useful, and a direct query mechanism for other information has been found
    useful in serverless environments and for debugging.  This memo defines an Experimental
    Protocol for the Internet community.</p>"
