abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes a technique for dynamically discovering the maximum
    transmission unit (MTU) of an arbitrary internet path. It specifies a small change
    to the way routers generate one type of ICMP message. For a path that passes through
    a router that has not been so changed, this technique might not discover the correct
    Path MTU, but it will always choose a Path MTU as accurate as, and in many cases
    more accurate than, the Path MTU that would be chosen by current practice. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
