abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes a technique for dynamically discovering the maximum
    transmission unit (MTU) of an arbitrary internet path.  It specifies a small change
    to the way routers generate one type of ICMP message.  For a path that passes
    through a router that has not been so changed, this technique might not discover
    the correct Path MTU, but it will always choose a Path MTU as accurate as, and
    in many cases more accurate than, the Path MTU that would be chosen by current
    practice. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
