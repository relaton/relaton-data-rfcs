abstract:
- content: "<p>The Layer Two Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) provides a method for tunneling
    PPP packets.  This document describes an extension to L2TP, to make efficient
    use of L2TP tunnels within the context of deploying multicast services whose data
    will have to be conveyed by these tunnels.  This memo defines an Experimental
    Protocol for the Internet community.</p>"
