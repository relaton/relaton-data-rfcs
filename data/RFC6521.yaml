abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a home agent-assisted route optimization functionality
    for the IPv4 Network Mobility Protocol.  The function is designed to facilitate
    optimal routing in cases where all nodes are connected to a single home agent;
    thus, the use case is route optimization within a single organization or similar
    entity.  The functionality enables the discovery of eligible peer nodes (based
    on information received from the home agent) and their network prefixes, and the
    establishment of a direct tunnel between such nodes.  This document defines an
    Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</p>"
