abstract:
- content: "<p>The effect of multipath routing on a forwarder is that the forwarder
    potentially has several next-hops for any given destination and must use some
    method to choose which next-hop should be used for a given data packet.  This
    memo summarizes current practices, problems, and solutions.  This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.</p>"
