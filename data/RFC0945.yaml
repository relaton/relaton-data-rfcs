abstract:
- content: "<p>In May 1983 the National Research Council (NRC) was asked jointly by
    DoD and NBS to study the issues and recommend a course of action. The final report
    of the NRC committee was published in February 1985 (see RFC-942). The enclosed
    letter is from Donald C. Latham (ASDC3I) to DCA transmitting the NRC report and
    requesting specific actions relative to the recommendations of the report. This
    RFC reproduces a letter from the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control,
    Communications, and Intelligence (ASDC3I) to the Director of the Defense Communications
    Agency (DCA). This letter is distributed for information only.</p>"
