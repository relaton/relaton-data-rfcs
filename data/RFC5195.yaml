abstract:
- content: <p>The purpose of this document is to define a BGP-based auto-discovery
    mechanism for Layer-1 VPNs (L1VPNs). The auto-discovery mechanism for L1VPNs allows
    the provider network devices to dynamically discover the set of Provider Edges
    (PEs) having ports attached to Customer Edge (CE) members of the same VPN. That
    information is necessary for completing the signaling phase of L1VPN connections.
    One main objective of a L1VPN auto-discovery mechanism is to support the "single-end
    provisioning" model, where addition of a new port to a given L1VPN would involve
    configuration changes only on the PE that has this port and on the CE that is
    connected to the PE via this port. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
