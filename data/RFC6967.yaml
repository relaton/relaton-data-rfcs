abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is a collection of potential solutions for revealing
    a host identifier (denoted as HOST_ID) when a Carrier Grade NAT (CGN) or application
    proxies are involved in the path. This host identifier could be used by a remote
    server to sort packets according to the sending host. The host identifier must
    be unique to each host under the same shared IP address.</p><p>This document analyzes
    a set of potential solutions for revealing a host identifier and does not recommend
    a particular solution, although it does highlight the hazards of some approaches.</p>"
