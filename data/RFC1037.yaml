abstract:
- content: "<p>This document includes a specification of the NFILE file access protocol
    and its underlying levels of protocol, the Token List Transport Layer and Byte
    Stream with Mark.  The goal of this specification is to promote discussion of
    the ideas described here, and to encourage designers of future file protocols
    to take advantage of these ideas.  A secondary goal is to make the specification
    available to sites that might benefit from implementing NFILE.</p>"
