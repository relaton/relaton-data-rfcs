abstract:
- content: <p>The Open Pluggable Edge Services (OPES) framework is application agnostic.
    Application-specific adaptations extend that framework. Previous work has focused
    on HTTP and work for SMTP is in progress. These protocols differ fundamentally
    in the way data flows, and it turns out that existing OPES requirements and IAB
    considerations for OPES need to be reviewed with regards to how well they fit
    for SMTP adaptation. This document analyzes aspects about the integrity of SMTP
    and mail message adaptation by OPES systems and about privacy and security issues
    when the OPES framework is adapted to SMTP. It also lists requirements that must
    be considered when creating the "SMTP adaptation with OPES" document.</p><p>The
    intent of this document is to capture this information before the current OPES
    working group shuts down. This is to provide input for subsequent working groups
    or individual contributors that may pick up the OPES/SMTP work at a later date.
    This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>
