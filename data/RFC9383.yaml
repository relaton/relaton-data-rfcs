abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes SPAKE2+, a Password-Authenticated Key Exchange
    (PAKE) protocol run between two parties for deriving a strong shared key with
    no risk of disclosing the password. SPAKE2+ is an augmented PAKE protocol, as
    only one party has knowledge of the password. This method is simple to implement,
    compatible with any prime-order group, and computationally efficient.</p><p>This
    document was produced outside of the IETF and IRTF and represents the opinions
    of the authors. Publication of this document as an RFC in the Independent Submissions
    Stream does not imply endorsement of SPAKE2+ by the IETF or IRTF.</p>"
