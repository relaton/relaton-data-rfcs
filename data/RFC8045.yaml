abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines three new RADIUS attributes.  For devices that
    implement IP port ranges, these attributes are used to communicate with a RADIUS
    server in order to configure and report IP transport ports as well as mapping
    behavior for specific hosts.  This mechanism can be used in various deployment
    scenarios such as Carrier-Grade NAT, IPv4/IPv6 translators, Provider WLAN gateway,
    etc.  This document defines a mapping between some RADIUS attributes and IP Flow
    Information Export (IPFIX) Information Element identifiers.</p>"
