abstract:
- content: "<p>During the transition from IPv4 to IPv6, customer equipment may have
    to support one of the various transition methods that have been defined for carrying
    IPv4 packets over IPv6. This document enumerates the information that needs to
    be provisioned on a customer edge router to support a list of transition techniques
    based on tunneling IPv4 in IPv6, with a view to defining reusable components for
    a reasonable transition path between these techniques. To the extent that the
    provisioning is done dynamically, Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting
    (AAA) support is needed to provide the information to the network server responsible
    for passing the information to the customer equipment. This document specifies
    Diameter (RFC 6733) Attribute-Value Pairs (AVPs) to be used for that purpose.</p>"
