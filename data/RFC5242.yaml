    sets for internationalized domain names and similar purposes.  This memo describes
    a fully unified coded character set for scripts based on Latin, Greek, Cyrillic,
    and Chinese (CJK) characters.  It is not a complete specification of that character
    set.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
