abstract:
- content: "<p>The IEEE 802.1 Provider Backbone Bridges (PBBs) specification defines
    an architecture and bridge protocols for interconnection of multiple Provider
    Bridged Networks (PBNs). Provider backbone bridging was defined by IEEE as a connectionless
    technology based on multipoint VLAN tunnels. PBB can be used to attain better
    scalability than Provider Bridges (PBs) in terms of the number of customer Media
    Access Control addresses and the number of service instances that can be supported.</p><p>The
    Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) provides a framework for extending Ethernet
    LAN services, using MPLS tunneling capabilities, through a routed MPLS backbone
    without running the Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP) or the Multiple Spanning
    Tree Protocol (MSTP) across the backbone. As a result, VPLS has been deployed
    on a large scale in service provider networks.</p><p>This document discusses extensions
    to the VPLS Provider Edge (PE) model required to incorporate desirable PBB components
    while maintaining the service provider fit of the initial model.</p>"
