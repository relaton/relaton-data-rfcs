    authentication mechanism using SecurID (a hardware token card product (or software
    emulation thereof) produced by RSA Security Inc., which is used for end-user authentication),
    thereby providing a means for such tokens to be used in SASL environments. This
    mechanism is only is only for authentication, and has no effect on the protocol
    encoding and is not designed to provide integrity or confidentiality services.
    This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
