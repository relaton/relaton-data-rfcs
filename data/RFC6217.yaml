abstract:
- content: "<p>Broadcasting is a technology that has been largely discarded in favor
    of technologies like multicast.  This document builds on RFC 919 and describes
    a more efficient routing mechanism for broadcast packets destined for multiple
    Local Area Networks (LANs) or Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) using an alternative
    link layer.  It significantly reduces congestion on network equipment and does
    not require additional physical infrastructure investment.  This document is not
    an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
