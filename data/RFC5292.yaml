abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines a new Outbound Router Filter (ORF) type for BGP,
    termed "Address Prefix Outbound Route Filter", that can be used to perform address-prefix-based
    route filtering.  This ORF-type supports prefix-length- or range-based matching,
    wild-card-based address prefix matching, as well as the exact address prefix matching
    for address families. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
