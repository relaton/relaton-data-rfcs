abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides an overview of E.164 telephone number portability
    (NP) in the Global Switched Telephone Network (GSTN).  NP is a regulatory imperative
    seeking to liberalize local telephony service competition, by enabling end-users
    to retain telephone numbers while changing service providers.  NP changes the
    fundamental nature of a dialed E.164 number from a hierarchical physical routing
    address to a virtual address, thereby requiring the transparent translation of
    the later to the former.  In addition, there are various regulatory constraints
    that establish relevant parameters for NP implementation, most of which are not
    network technology specific.  Consequently, the implementation of NP behavior
    consistent with applicable regulatory constraints, as well as the need for interoperation
    with the existing GSTN NP implementations, are relevant topics for numerous areas
    of IP telephony works-in-progress with the IETF.  This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.</p>"
