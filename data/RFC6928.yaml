abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes an experiment to increase the permitted TCP
    initial window (IW) from between 2 and 4 segments, as specified in RFC 3390, to
    10 segments with a fallback to the existing recommendation when performance issues
    are detected.  It discusses the motivation behind the increase, the advantages
    and disadvantages of the higher initial window, and presents results from several
    large-scale experiments showing that the higher initial window improves the overall
    performance of many web services without resulting in a congestion collapse.  The
    document closes with a discussion of usage and deployment for further experimental
    purposes recommended by the IETF TCP Maintenance and Minor Extensions (TCPM) working
    group.</p>"
