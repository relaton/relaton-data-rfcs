abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a means of negotiating the use of the encrypt-then-MAC
    security mechanism in place of the existing MAC-then-encrypt mechanism in Transport
    Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS).  The MAC-then-encrypt
    mechanism has been the subject of a number of security vulnerabilities over a
    period of many years.</p>"
