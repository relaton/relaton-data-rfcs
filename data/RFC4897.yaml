abstract:
- content: <p>The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and Request for Comments
    (RFC) Editor have a long-standing rule that a document at a given maturity level
    cannot be published until all of the documents that it references as normative
    are at that maturity level or higher.  This rule has sometimes resulted in very
    long publication delays for documents and some claims that it was a major obstruction
    to advancing documents in maturity level.  The IETF agreed on a way to bypass
    this rule with RFC 3967.  This document describes a simpler procedure for downward
    references to Standards-Track and Best Current Practice (BCP) documents, namely
    "note and move on".  The procedure in RFC 3967 still applies for downward references
    to other classes of documents.  In both cases, annotations should be added to
    such References.  This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for
    the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.</p>
