abstract:
- content: <p>There is a long-standing tradition in the Internet community, predating
    the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) by many years, of use of the RFC Series
    to publish materials that are not rooted in the IETF standards process and its
    review and approval mechanisms.  These documents, known as "Independent Submissions",
    serve a number of important functions for the Internet community, both inside
    and outside of the community of active IETF participants.  This document discusses
    the Independent Submission model and some reasons why it is important.  It then
    describes editorial and processing norms that can be used for Independent Submissions
    as the community goes forward into new relationships between the IETF community
    and its primary technical publisher.  This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.</p>
