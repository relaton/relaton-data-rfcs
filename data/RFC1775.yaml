abstract:
- content: <p>The Internet permits different levels of access for consumers and providers
    of service.  The nature of those differences is quite important in the capabilities
    They afford.  Hence, it is appropriate to provide terminology that distinguishes
    among the range, so that the Internet community can gain some clarity when distinguishing
    whether a user (or an organization) is "on" the Internet.  This document suggests
    four terms, for distinguishing the major classes of access.  This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.  This memo does not specify an Internet
    standard of any kind.</p>
