abstract:
- content: <p>The DoD Internet protocol suite includes two alternative transport service
    protocols, TCP and UDP, which provide virtual circuit and datagram service, respectively.  These
    two protocols represent points in the space of possible transport service attributes
    which are quite "far apart".  We want to examine an important class of applications,
    those which perform what is often called "transaction processing".  We will see
    that the communication needs for these applications fall into the gap "between"
    TCP and UDP -- neither protocol is very appropriate.  This RFC is concerned with
    the possible design of one or more new protocols for the ARPA-Internet, to support
    kinds of applications which are not well supported at present.  The RFC is intended
    to spur discussion in the Internet research community towards the development
    of new protocols and/or concepts, in order to meet these unmet application requirements.  It
    does not represent a standard, nor even a concrete protocol proposal.</p>
