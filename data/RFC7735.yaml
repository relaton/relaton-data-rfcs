abstract:
- content: "<p>Several review teams ensure specific types of review are performed
    on Internet-Drafts as they progress towards becoming RFCs.  The tools used by
    these teams to assign and track reviews would benefit from tighter integration
    to the Datatracker.  This document discusses requirements for improving those
    tools without disrupting current work flows.</p>"
