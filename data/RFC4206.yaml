abstract:
- content: "<p>To improve scalability of Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching
    (GMPLS) it may be useful to aggregate Label Switched Paths (LSPs) by creating
    a hierarchy of such LSPs. A way to create such a hierarchy is by (a) a Label Switching
    Router (LSR) creating a Traffic Engineering Label Switched Path (TE LSP), (b)
    the LSR forming a forwarding adjacency (FA) out of that LSP (by advertising this
    LSP as a Traffic Engineering (TE) link into the same instance of ISIS/OSPF as
    the one that was used to create the LSP), (c) allowing other LSRs to use FAs for
    their path computation, and (d) nesting of LSPs originated by other LSRs into
    that LSP (by using the label stack construct).</p><p>This document describes the
    mechanisms to accomplish this. [PROPOSED STANDARD]</p>"
