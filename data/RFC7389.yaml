abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a method to split the control plane (CP) and
    user plane (UP) for a network infrastructure based on Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6).
    Existing specifications allow a mobile access gateway (MAG) to separate its control
    and user plane using the Alternate Care-of Address mobility option for IPv6 or
    Alternate IPv4 Care-of Address option for IPv4. However, the current specification
    does not provide any mechanism allowing the local mobility anchor (LMA) to perform
    an analogous functional split. To remedy that shortcoming, this document specifies
    a mobility option enabling an LMA to provide an alternate LMA address to be used
    for the bidirectional user-plane traffic between the MAG and LMA. With this new
    option, an LMA will be able to use an IP address for its user plane that is different
    than the IP address used for the control plane.</p>"
