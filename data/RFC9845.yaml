abstract:
- content: <p>Reducing humankind's environmental footprint and making technology more
    environmentally sustainable are among the biggest challenges of our age. Networks
    play an important part in this challenge. On one hand, they enable applications
    that help to reduce this footprint. On the other hand, they significantly contribute
    to this footprint themselves. Therefore, methods to make networking technology
    itself "greener" and to manage and operate networks in ways that reduce their
    environmental footprint without impacting their utility need to be explored. This
    document outlines a corresponding set of opportunities, along with associated
    research challenges, for networking technology in general and management technology
    in particular to become greener, i.e., more sustainable, with reduced greenhouse
    gas emissions and less negative impact on the environment.</p><p>This document
    is a product of the Network Management Research Group (NMRG) of the Internet Research
    Task Force (IRTF). This document reflects the consensus of the research group.
    It is not a candidate for any level of Internet Standard and is published for
    informational purposes.</p>
