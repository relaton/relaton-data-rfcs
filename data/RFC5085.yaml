- content: "<p>This document describes Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification (VCCV),
    which provides a control channel that is associated with a pseudowire (PW), as
    well as the corresponding operations and management functions (such as connectivity
    verification) to be used over that control channel.  VCCV applies to all supported
    access circuit and transport types currently defined for PWs. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
