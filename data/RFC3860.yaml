abstract:
- content: "<p>At the time this document was written, numerous instant messaging protocols
    were in use, and little interoperability between services based on these protocols
    has been achieved.  This specification defines common semantics and data formats
    for instant messaging to facilitate the creation of gateways between instant messaging
    services. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
