abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism for a restarting router to signal
    to its neighbors that it is restarting, allowing them to reestablish their adjacencies
    without cycling through the DOWN state while still correctly initiating database
    synchronization.</p><p>This document additionally describes a mechanism for a
    router to signal its neighbors that it is preparing to initiate a restart while
    maintaining forwarding-plane state. This allows the neighbors to maintain their
    adjacencies until the router has restarted but also allows the neighbors to bring
    the adjacencies down in the event of other topology changes.</p><p>This document
    additionally describes a mechanism for a restarting router to determine when it
    has achieved Link State Protocol Data Unit (LSP) database synchronization with
    its neighbors and a mechanism to optimize LSP database synchronization while minimizing
    transient routing disruption when a router starts.</p><p>This document obsoletes
    RFC 5306.</p>"
