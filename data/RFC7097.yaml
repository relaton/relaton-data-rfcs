abstract:
- content: "<p>The RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) is used in conjunction with the Real-
    time Transport Protocol (RTP) in order to provide a variety of short- term and
    long-term reception statistics. The available reporting may include aggregate
    information across longer periods of time as well as individual packet reporting.
    This document specifies a per-packet report metric capturing individual packets
    discarded from the de- jitter buffer after successful reception.</p>"
