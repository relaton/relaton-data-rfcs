abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines a set of cryptographic transforms for use in the
    Internet Key Exchange Protocol version 2 (IKEv2). The transforms are based on
    Russian cryptographic standard algorithms (called "GOST" algorithms). Use of GOST
    ciphers in IKEv2 is defined in RFC 9227. This document aims to define the use
    of GOST algorithms for the rest of the cryptographic transforms used in IKEv2.</p><p>This
    specification was developed to facilitate implementations that wish to support
    the GOST algorithms. This document does not imply IETF endorsement of the cryptographic
    algorithms used in this document.</p>
