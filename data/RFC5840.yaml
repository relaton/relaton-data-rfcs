abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Wrapped Encapsulating Security Payload
    (WESP) protocol, which builds on the Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) RFC
    4303 and is designed to allow intermediate devices to (1) ascertain if data confidentiality
    is being employed within ESP, and if not, (2) inspect the IPsec packets for network
    monitoring and access control functions.  Currently, in the IPsec ESP standard,
    there is no deterministic way to differentiate between encrypted and unencrypted
    payloads by simply examining a packet.  This poses certain challenges to the intermediate
    devices that need to deep inspect the packet before making a decision on what
    should be done with that packet (Inspect and/or Allow/Drop).  The mechanism described
    in this document can be used to easily disambiguate integrity-only ESP from ESP-encrypted
    packets, without compromising on the security provided by ESP. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
