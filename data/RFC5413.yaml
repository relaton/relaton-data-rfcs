abstract:
- content: "<p>The Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) problem
    statement describes a problem that needs to be addressed before a wireless LAN
    (WLAN) network designer can construct a solution composed of Wireless Termination
    Points (WTP) and Access Controllers (AC) from multiple, different vendors. One
    of the primary goals is to find a solution that solves the interoperability between
    the two classes of devices (WTPs and ACs) that then enables an AC from one vendor
    to control and manage a WTP from another.</p><p>In this document, we present a
    protocol that forms the common technology-independent framework and the ability
    to negotiate and add, on top of this framework, a control protocol that contains
    a technology-dependent component to arrive at a complete solution. We have also
    presented two such control protocols -- an 802.11 Control protocol, and another,
    more generic image download protocol, in this document.</p><p>Even though the
    text in this document is written to specifically address the problem stated in
    RFC 3990, the solution can be applied to any problem that has a controller (equivalent
    to the AC) managing one or more network elements (equivalent to the WTP). This
    document defines a Historic Document for the Internet community.</p>"
