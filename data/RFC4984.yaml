abstract:
- content: "<p>This document reports the outcome of the Routing and Addressing Workshop
    that was held by the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) on October 18-19, 2006,
    in Amsterdam, Netherlands. The primary goal of the workshop was to develop a shared
    understanding of the problems that the large backbone operators are facing regarding
    the scalability of today's Internet routing system. The key workshop findings
    include an analysis of the major factors that are driving routing table growth,
    constraints in router technology, and the limitations of today's Internet addressing
    architecture. It is hoped that these findings will serve as input to the IETF
    community and help identify next steps towards effective solutions.</p><p>Note
    that this document is a report on the proceedings of the workshop. The views and
    positions documented in this report are those of the workshop participants and
    not of the IAB. Furthermore, note that work on issues related to this workshop
    report is continuing, and this document does not intend to reflect the increased
    understanding of issues nor to discuss the range of potential solutions that may
    be the outcome of this ongoing work. This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.</p>"
