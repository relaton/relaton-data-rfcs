abstract:
- content: "<p>In customer sites having IPv4-only Customer Premises Equipment (CPE),
    Teredo (RFC 4380, RFC 5991, RFC 6081) provides last-resort IPv6 connectivity.
    However, because it is designed to work without the involvement of Internet Service
    Providers, it has significant limitations (connectivity between IPv6 native addresses
    and Teredo addresses is uncertain; connectivity between Teredo addresses fails
    for some combinations of NAT types). 6a44 is a complementary solution that, being
    based on ISP cooperation, avoids these limitations. At the beginning of 6a44 IPv6
    addresses, it replaces the Teredo well-known prefix, present at the beginning
    of Teredo IPv6 addresses, with network-specific /48 prefixes assigned by local
    ISPs (an evolution similar to that from 6to4 to 6rd (IPv6 Rapid Deployment on
    IPv4 Infrastructures)). The specification is expected to be complete enough for
    running code to be independently written and the solution to be incrementally
    deployed and used. This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet
    community.</p>"
