abstract:
- content: "<p>This document addresses the communication between an application server
    and media server. The current work in IETF working groups shows these logical
    entities, but it does not address the physical decomposition and the protocol
    between the entities.</p><p>This document presents the requirements for a Media
    Server Control Protocol (MCP) that enables an application server to use a media
    server. It will address the aspects of announcements, Interactive Voice Response,
    and conferencing media services. This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.</p>"
