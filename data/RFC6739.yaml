abstract:
- content: "<p>The Location-to-Service Translation (LoST) protocol is an XML-based
    protocol for mapping service identifiers and geodetic or civic location information
    to service URIs and service boundaries. In particular, it can be used to determine
    the location-appropriate Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) for emergency services.</p><p>The
    element in the LoST protocol specification encapsulates information about service
    boundaries and circumscribes the region within which all locations map to the
    same service Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) or set of URIs for a given service.</p><p>This
    document defines an XML protocol to exchange these mappings between two nodes.
    This mechanism is designed for the exchange of authoritative elements between
    two entities. Exchanging cached elements, i.e., non-authoritative elements, is
    possible but not envisioned. Even though the element format is reused from the
    LoST specification, the mechanism in this document can be used without the LoST
    protocol. This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</p>"
