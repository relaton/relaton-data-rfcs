abstract:
- content: '<p>In a distributed, constraint-based routing environment, the information
    used to compute a path may be out of date. This means that Multiprotocol Label
    Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic Engineered (TE) Label Switched
    Path (LSP) setup requests may be blocked by links or nodes without sufficient
    resources. Crankback is a scheme whereby setup failure information is returned
    from the point of failure to allow new setup attempts to be made avoiding the
    blocked resources. Crankback can also be applied to LSP recovery to indicate the
    location of the failed link or node.</p><p>This document specifies crankback signaling
    extensions for use in MPLS signaling using RSVP-TE as defined in "RSVP-TE: Extensions
    to RSVP for LSP Tunnels", RFC 3209, and GMPLS signaling as defined in "Generalized
    Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Signaling Functional Description", RFC
    3473. These extensions mean that the LSP setup request can be retried on an alternate
    path that detours around blocked links or nodes. This offers significant improvements
    in the successful setup and recovery ratios for LSPs, especially in situations
    where a large number of setup requests are triggered at the same time. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>'
