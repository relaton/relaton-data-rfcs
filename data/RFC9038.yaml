abstract:
- content: <p>The Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP), as defined in RFC 5730,
    includes a method for the client and server to determine the objects to be managed
    during a session and the object extensions to be used during a session.  The services
    are identified using namespace URIs, and an "unhandled namespace" is one that
    is associated with a service not supported by the client.  This document defines
    an operational practice that enables the server to return information associated
    with unhandled namespace URIs and that maintains compliance with the negotiated
    services defined in RFC 5730.</p>
