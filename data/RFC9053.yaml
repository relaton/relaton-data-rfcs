abstract:
- content: "<p>Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) is a data format designed
    for small code size and small message size. There is a need to be able to define
    basic security services for this data format. This document defines a set of algorithms
    that can be used with the CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) protocol (RFC
    9052).</p><p>This document, along with RFC 9052, obsoletes RFC 8152.</p>"
