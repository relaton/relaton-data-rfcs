abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF makes heavy use of email lists to conduct its work.  Participants
    frequently need to search and browse the archives of these lists and have asked
    for improved search capabilities.  The current archive mechanism could also be
    made more efficient.  This memo captures the requirements for improved email list
    archiving and searching systems.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track
    specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
