abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies automated bootstrapping of an Autonomic Control
    Plane.  To do this, a Secure Key Infrastructure is bootstrapped.  This is done
    using manufacturer-installed X.509 certificates, in combination with a manufacturer's
    authorizing service, both online and offline.  We call this process the Bootstrapping
    Remote Secure Key Infrastructure (BRSKI) protocol.  Bootstrapping a new device
    can occur when using a routable address and a cloud service, only link-local connectivity,
    or limited/disconnected networks.  Support for deployment models with less stringent
    security requirements is included.  Bootstrapping is complete when the cryptographic
    identity of the new key infrastructure is successfully deployed to the device.
    \ The established secure connection can be used to deploy a locally issued certificate
    to the device as well.</p>"
