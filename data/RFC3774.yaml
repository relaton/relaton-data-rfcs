abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo summarizes perceived problems in the structure, function,
    and processes of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). We are attempting
    to identify these problems, so that they can be addressed and corrected by the
    IETF community. The problems have been digested and categorized from an extensive
    discussion which took place on the 'problem-statement' mailing list from November
    2002 to September 2003. The problem list has been further analyzed in an attempt
    to determine the root causes at the heart of the perceived problems: The result
    will be used to guide the next stage of the process in the Problem Statement working
    group which is to recommend the structures and processes that will carry out the
    corrections. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
