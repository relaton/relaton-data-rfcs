abstract:
- content: "<p>The DNS ZONEVERSION option is a way for DNS clients to request, and
    for authoritative DNS servers to provide, information regarding the version of
    the zone from which a response is generated. The SERIAL field from the Start of
    Authority (SOA) resource record (RR) is a good example of a zone's version, and
    it is the only one defined by this specification. Additional version types may
    be defined by future specifications.</p><p>Including zone version data in a response
    simplifies and improves the quality of debugging and diagnostics since the version
    and the DNS answer are provided atomically. This can be especially useful for
    zones and DNS providers that leverage IP anycast or multiple backend systems.
    It functions similarly to the DNS Name Server Identifier (NSID) option described
    in RFC 5001.</p>"
