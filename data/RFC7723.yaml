abstract:
- content: "<p>The Port Control Protocol (PCP) anycast addresses enable PCP clients
    to transmit signaling messages to their closest PCP-aware on-path NAT, firewall,
    or other middlebox without having to learn the IP address of that middlebox via
    some external channel.  This document establishes one well-known IPv4 address
    and one well-known IPv6 address to be used as PCP anycast addresses.</p>"
