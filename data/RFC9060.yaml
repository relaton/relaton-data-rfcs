abstract:
- content: "<p>The Secure Telephone Identity Revisited (STIR) certificate profile
    provides a way to attest authority over telephone numbers and related identifiers
    for the purpose of preventing telephone number spoofing.  This specification details
    how that authority can be delegated from a parent certificate to a subordinate
    certificate.  This supports a number of use cases, including those where service
    providers grant credentials to enterprises or other customers capable of signing
    calls with STIR.</p>"
