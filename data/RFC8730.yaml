abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the function and responsibilities of the RFC
    Independent Submission Editor (ISE). The Independent Submission stream is one
    of the stream producers that create draft RFCs, with the ISE as its stream approver.
    The ISE is overall responsible for activities within the Independent Submission
    stream, working with draft editors and reviewers, and interacts with the RFC Production
    Center and Publisher, and the RFC Series Editor (RSE). The ISE is appointed by
    the IAB, and also interacts with the IETF Administration Limited Liability Company
    (LLC).</p><p>This version obsoletes RFC 6548 to replace all references to the
    Internet Administrative Support Activity (IASA) and related structures with those
    defined by the IASA 2.0 structure.</p>"
