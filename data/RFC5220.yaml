abstract:
- content: "<p>A single physical link can have multiple prefixes assigned to it.  In
    that environment, end hosts might have multiple IP addresses and be required to
    use them selectively.  RFC 3484 defines default source and destination address
    selection rules and is implemented in a variety of OSs.  But, it has been too
    difficult to use operationally for several reasons.  In some environments where
    multiple prefixes are assigned on a single physical link, the host using the default
    address selection rules will experience some trouble in communication.  This document
    describes the possible problems that end hosts could encounter in an environment
    with multiple prefixes.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
