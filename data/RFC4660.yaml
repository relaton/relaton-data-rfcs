abstract:
- content: "<p>The SIP event notification framework describes the usage of the Session
    Initiation Protocol (SIP) for subscriptions and notifications of changes to the
    state of a resource. The document does not describe a mechanism whereby filtering
    of event notification information can be achieved.</p><p>This document describes
    the operations a subscriber performs in order to put filtering rules associated
    with a subscription to event notification information in place. The handling,
    by the subscriber, of responses to subscriptions carrying filtering rules and
    the handling of notifications with filtering rules applied to them are also described.
    Furthermore, the document conveys how the notifier behaves when receiving such
    filtering rules and how a notification is constructed. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
