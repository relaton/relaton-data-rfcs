abstract:
- content: <p>Although there are many perceived benefits to Network Address Translation
    (NAT), its primary benefit of "amplifying" available address space is not needed
    in IPv6.  In addition to NAT's many serious disadvantages, there is a perception
    that other benefits exist, such as a variety of management and security attributes
    that could be useful for an Internet Protocol site.  IPv6 was designed with the
    intention of making NAT unnecessary, and this document shows how Local Network
    Protection (LNP) using IPv6 can provide the same or more benefits without the
    need for address translation.  This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.</p>
