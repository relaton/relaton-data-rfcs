abstract:
- content: "<p>The Differentiated Services (Diffserv) architecture specifies use of
    the DS field in the IPv4 and IPv6 packet headers to carry one of 64 distinct differentiated
    services field codepoint (DSCP) values. The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
    (IANA) maintains a registry of assigned DSCP values.</p><p>This update to RFC
    2474 changes the IANA registration policy for Pool 3 of the registry (i.e., DSCP
    values of the form xxxx01) to Standards Action, i.e., values are assigned through
    a Standards Track or Best Current Practice RFC. The update also removes permission
    for experimental and local use of the codepoints that form Pool 3 of the DSCP
    registry; Pool 2 Codepoints (i.e., DSCP values of the form xxxx11) remain available
    for these purposes.</p>"
