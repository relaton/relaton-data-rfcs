abstract:
- content: <p>Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) requires that messages be transmitted
    at regular intervals and provides a way to negotiate the interval used by BFD
    peers. Some BFD implementations may be restricted to only support several interval
    values. When such BFD implementations speak to each other, there is a possibility
    of two sides not being able to find a common value for the interval to run BFD
    sessions.</p><p>This document updates RFC 5880 by defining a small set of interval
    values for BFD that we call "Common Intervals" and recommends implementations
    to support the defined intervals. This solves the problem of finding an interval
    value that both BFD speakers can support while allowing a simplified implementation
    as seen for hardware-based BFD. It does not restrict an implementation from supporting
    more intervals in addition to the Common Intervals.</p>
