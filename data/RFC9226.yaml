abstract:
- content: "<p>The prevailing hexadecimal system was chosen for congruence with groups
    of four binary digits, but its design exhibits an indifference to cognitive factors.
    \ An alternative is introduced that is designed to reduce brain cycles in cases
    where a hexadecimal number should be readily convertible to binary by a human
    being.</p>"
