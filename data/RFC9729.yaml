abstract:
- content: "<p>Most HTTP authentication schemes are probeable in the sense that it
    is possible for an unauthenticated client to probe whether an origin serves resources
    that require authentication. It is possible for an origin to hide the fact that
    it requires authentication by not generating Unauthorized status codes; however,
    that only works with non-cryptographic authentication schemes: cryptographic signatures
    require a fresh nonce to be signed. Prior to this document, there was no existing
    way for the origin to share such a nonce without exposing the fact that it serves
    resources that require authentication. This document defines a new non-probeable
    cryptographic authentication scheme.</p>"
