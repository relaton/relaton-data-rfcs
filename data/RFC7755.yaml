abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the use of the Stateless IP/ICMP Translation
    Algorithm (SIIT) in an IPv6 Internet Data Center (IDC). In this deployment model,
    traffic from legacy IPv4-only clients on the Internet is translated to IPv6 upon
    reaching the IDC operator's network infrastructure. From that point on, it may
    be treated the same as traffic from native IPv6 end users. The IPv6 endpoints
    may be numbered using arbitrary (non-IPv4-translatable) IPv6 addresses. This facilitates
    a single-stack IPv6-only network infrastructure, as well as efficient utilization
    of public IPv4 addresses.</p><p>The primary audience is IDC operators who are
    deploying IPv6, running out of available IPv4 addresses, and/or feeling that dual
    stack causes undesirable operational complexity.</p>"
