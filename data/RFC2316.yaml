abstract:
- content: "<p>On 3-5 March 1997, the IAB held a security architecture workshop at
    Bell Labs in Murray Hill, NJ.  We identified the core security components of the
    architecture, and specified several documents that need to be written.  Most importantly,
    we agreed that security was not optional, and that it needed to be designed in
    from the beginning.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.
    \ It does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.</p>"
