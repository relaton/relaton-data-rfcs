abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies a mechanism referred to as "Intent-Driven Service
    Mapping". The mechanism uses BGP to express Intent-based association of overlay
    routes with underlay routes having specific Traffic Engineering (TE) characteristics
    satisfying a certain Service Level Agreement (SLA). This is achieved by defining
    new constructs to group underlay routes with sufficiently similar TE characteristics
    into identifiable classes (called "Transport Classes" or "TCs"), that overlay
    routes use as an ordered set to resolve reachability (Resolution Schemes) towards
    service endpoints. These constructs can be used, for example, to realize the "IETF
    Network Slice" defined in the TEAS Network Slices framework (RFC 9543).</p><p>Additionally,
    this document specifies protocol procedures for BGP that enable dissemination
    of service mapping information in a network that may span multiple cooperating
    administrative domains. These domains may be administered either by the same provider
    or by closely coordinating providers. A new BGP address family that leverages
    the procedures described in RFC 4364 ("BGP/MPLS IP Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)")
    and follows the NLRI encoding described in RFC 8277 ("Using BGP to Bind MPLS Labels
    to Address Prefixes") is defined to enable each advertised underlay route to be
    identified by its class. This new address family is called "BGP Classful Transport"
    (or "BGP CT").</p>
