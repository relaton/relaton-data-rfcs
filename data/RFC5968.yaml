abstract:
- content: "<p>The RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) is used along with the Real-time Transport
    Protocol (RTP) to provide a control channel between media senders and receivers.
    \ This allows constructing a feedback loop to enable application adaptation and
    monitoring, among other uses.  The basic reporting mechanisms offered by RTCP
    are generic, yet quite powerful and suffice to cover a range of uses.  This document
    provides guidelines on extending RTCP if those basic mechanisms prove insufficient.
    \ This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published
    for informational purposes.</p>"
