abstract:
- content: "<p>This document extends HSS/LMS (RFC 8554) by defining parameter sets
    that use alternative hash functions. These include hash functions that result
    in signatures with significantly smaller sizes than the signatures that use the
    RFC 8554 parameter sets and should have sufficient security.</p><p>This document
    is a product of the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF). The IRTF publishes the
    results of Internet-related research and development activities. These results
    might not be suitable for deployment. This RFC represents the consensus of the
    Crypto Forum Research Group of the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF). Documents
    approved for publication by the IRSG are not candidates for any level of Internet
    Standard; see Section 2 of RFC 7841.</p>"
