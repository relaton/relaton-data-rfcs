abstract:
- content: <p>Allied Communications Publication (ACP) 142 defines P_MUL, which is
    a protocol for reliable multicast suitable for bandwidth-constrained and delayed
    acknowledgement (Emissions Control or "EMCON") environments running over UDP.
    This document defines MULE (Multicast Email), an application protocol for transferring
    Internet Mail messages (as described in RFC 5322) over P_MUL (as defined in ACP
    142). MULE enables transfer between Message Transfer Agents (MTAs). It doesn't
    provide a service similar to SMTP Submission (as described in RFC 6409).</p><p>This
    document explains how MULE can be used in conjunction with SMTP (RFC 5321), including
    some common SMTP extensions, to provide an alternate MTA-to-MTA transfer mechanism.</p><p>This
    is not an IETF specification; it describes an existing implementation. It is provided
    in order to facilitate interoperable implementations and third-party diagnostics.</p>
