abstract:
- content: <p>This memo is intended to explore how Type-of-Service might be implemented
    in the Internet. The proposal describes a method of queuing which can provide
    the different classes of service. The technique also prohibits one class of service
    from consuming excessive resources or excluding other classes of service. This
    is an "idea paper" and discussion is strongly encouraged.</p>
