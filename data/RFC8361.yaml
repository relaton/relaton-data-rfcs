abstract:
- content: "<p>In Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL) active-active
    access, a Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF) check failure issue may occur when using
    the pseudo-nickname mechanism specified in RFC 7781.  This document describes
    a solution to resolve this RPF check failure issue through centralized replication.
    \ All ingress Routing Bridges (RBridges) send Broadcast, Unknown Unicast, and
    Multicast (BUM) traffic to a centralized node with unicast TRILL encapsulation.
    \ When the centralized node receives the BUM traffic, it decapsulates the packets
    and forwards them to their destination RBridges using a distribution tree established
    per the TRILL base protocol (RFC 6325).  To avoid RPF check failure on an RBridge
    sitting between the ingress RBridge and the centralized replication node, some
    change in the RPF calculation algorithm is required.  RPF checks on each RBridge
    MUST be calculated as if the centralized node was the ingress RBridge, instead
    of being calculated using the actual ingress RBridge.  This document updates RFC
    6325.</p>"
