abstract:
- content: <p>The Designated Forwarder (DF) in Ethernet Virtual Private Networks (EVPNs)
    is defined as the Provider Edge (PE) router responsible for sending Broadcast,
    Unknown Unicast, and Multicast (BUM) traffic to a multihomed device/network in
    the case of an All-Active multihoming Ethernet Segment (ES) or BUM and unicast
    in the case of Single-Active multihoming. The Designated Forwarder is selected
    out of a candidate list of PEs that advertise the same Ethernet Segment Identifier
    (ESI) to the EVPN network, according to the default DF election algorithm. While
    the default algorithm provides an efficient and automated way of selecting the
    Designated Forwarder across different Ethernet Tags in the Ethernet Segment, there
    are some use cases where a more "deterministic" and user-controlled method is
    required. At the same time, Network Operators require an easy way to force an
    on-demand Designated Forwarder switchover in order to carry out some maintenance
    tasks on the existing Designated Forwarder or control whether a new active PE
    can preempt the existing Designated Forwarder PE.</p><p>This document proposes
    use of a DF election algorithm that meets the requirements of determinism and
    operation control. This document updates RFC 8584 by modifying the definition
    of the DF Election Extended Community.</p>
