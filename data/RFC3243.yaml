abstract:
- content: "<p>This document contains requirements for the 0-byte IP/UDP/RTP (Internet
    Protocol/User Datagram Protocol/Real-Time Transport Protocol) header compression
    scheme to be developed by the Robust Header Compression (ROHC) Working Group.
    \ It also includes the basic assumptions for the typical link layers over which
    0-byte compression may be implemented, and assumptions about its usage in general.</p>"
