abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the procedures and recommendations for Virtual
    Private LAN Service (VPLS) Provider Edges (PEs) to facilitate replication of multicast
    traffic to only certain ports (behind which there are interested Protocol Independent
    Multicast (PIM) routers and/or Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) hosts)
    via PIM snooping and proxying.</p><p>With PIM snooping, PEs passively listen to
    certain PIM control messages to build control and forwarding states while transparently
    flooding those messages. With PIM proxying, PEs do not flood PIM Join/Prune messages
    but only generate their own and send them out of certain ports, based on the control
    states built from downstream Join/Prune messages. PIM proxying is required when
    PIM Join suppression is enabled on the Customer Edge (CE) devices and is useful
    for reducing PIM control traffic in a VPLS domain.</p><p>This document also describes
    PIM relay, which can be viewed as lightweight proxying, where all downstream Join/Prune
    messages are simply forwarded out of certain ports and are not flooded, thereby
    avoiding the triggering of PIM Join suppression on CE devices.</p>"
