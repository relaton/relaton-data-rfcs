abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces the Scalable Address Resolution Protocol (SARP),
    an architecture that uses proxy gateways to scale large data center networks.
    \ SARP is based on fast proxies that significantly reduce switches' Filtering
    Database (FDB) table sizes and reduce impact of ARP and Neighbor Discovery (ND)
    on network elements in an environment where hosts within one subnet (or VLAN)
    can spread over various locations.  SARP is targeted for massive data centers
    with a significant number of Virtual Machines (VMs) that can move across various
    physical locations.</p>"
