abstract:
- content: <p>Test engineers take pains to declare all factors that affect a given
    measurement, including intended load, packet length, test duration, and traffic
    orientation. However, current benchmarking practice overlooks two factors that
    have a profound impact on test results. First, existing methodologies do not require
    the reporting of addresses or other test traffic contents, even though these fields
    can affect test results. Second, "stuff" bits and bytes inserted in test traffic
    by some link-layer technologies add significant and variable overhead, which in
    turn affects test results. This document describes the effects of these factors;
    recommends guidelines for test traffic contents; and offers formulas for determining
    the probability of bit- and byte-stuffing in test traffic. This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.</p>
