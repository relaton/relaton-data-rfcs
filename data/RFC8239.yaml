abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of this informational document is to establish test and
    evaluation methodology and measurement techniques for physical network equipment
    in the data center.  RFC 8238 is a prerequisite for this document, as it contains
    terminology that is considered normative.  Many of these terms and methods may
    be applicable beyond the scope of this document as the technologies originally
    applied in the data center are deployed elsewhere.</p>"
