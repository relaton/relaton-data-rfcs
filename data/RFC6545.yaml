abstract:
- content: "<p>Security incidents, such as system compromises, worms, viruses, phishing
    incidents, and denial of service, typically result in the loss of service, data,
    and resources both human and system.  Service providers and Computer Security
    Incident Response Teams need to be equipped and ready to assist in communicating
    and tracing security incidents with tools and procedures in place before the occurrence
    of an attack.  Real-time Inter-network Defense (RID) outlines a proactive inter-network
    communication method to facilitate sharing incident-handling data while integrating
    existing detection, tracing, source identification, and mitigation mechanisms
    for a complete incident-handling solution.  Combining these capabilities in a
    communication system provides a way to achieve higher security levels on networks.
    \ Policy guidelines for handling incidents are recommended and can be agreed upon
    by a consortium using the security recommendations and considerations.  This document
    obsoletes RFC 6045. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
