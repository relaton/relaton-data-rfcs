abstract:
- content: "<p>The Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) suite of protocols
    has been defined to control different switching technologies as well as different
    applications. These include support for requesting Time Division Multiplexing
    (TDM) connections including Synchronous Optical Network (SONET)/Synchronous Digital
    Hierarchy (SDH) and Optical Transport Networks (OTNs).</p><p>This document concentrates
    on the routing requirements placed on the GMPLS suite of protocols in order to
    support the capabilities and functionalities of an Automatically Switched Optical
    Network (ASON) as defined by the ITU-T. This memo provides information for the
    Internet community.</p>"
