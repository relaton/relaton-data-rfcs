abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines a "manifest" for use in the Resource Public Key
    Infrastructure (RPKI).  A manifest is a signed object (file) that contains a listing
    of all the signed objects (files) in the repository publication point (directory)
    associated with an authority responsible for publishing in the repository.  For
    each certificate, Certificate Revocation List (CRL), or other type of signed objects
    issued by the authority that are published at this repository publication point,
    the manifest contains both the name of the file containing the object and a hash
    of the file content.  Manifests are intended to enable a relying party (RP) to
    detect certain forms of attacks against a repository.  Specifically, if an RP
    checks a manifest's contents against the signed objects retrieved from a repository
    publication point, then the RP can detect "stale" (valid) data and deletion of
    signed objects. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
