abstract:
- content: "<p>This document reports the outcome of a workshop held by the Internet
    Architecture Board (IAB) on Unwanted Internet Traffic.  The workshop was held
    on March 9-10, 2006 at USC/ISI in Marina del Rey, CA, USA.  The primary goal of
    the workshop was to foster interchange between the operator, standards, and research
    communities on the topic of unwanted traffic, as manifested in, for example, Distributed
    Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, spam, and phishing, to gain understandings on
    the ultimate sources of these unwanted traffic, and to assess their impact and
    the effectiveness of existing solutions.  It was also a goal of the workshop to
    identify engineering and research topics that could be undertaken by the IAB,
    the IETF, the IRTF, and the network research and development community at large
    to develop effective countermeasures against the unwanted traffic.  This memo
    provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
