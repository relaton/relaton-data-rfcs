abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a protocol which allows nodes to remain reachable
    while moving around in the IPv6 Internet.  Each mobile node is always identified
    by its home address, regardless of its current point of attachment to the Internet.
    \ While situated away from its home, a mobile node is also associated with a care-of
    address, which provides information about the mobile node's current location.
    \ IPv6 packets addressed to a mobile node's home address are transparently routed
    to its care-of address.  The protocol enables IPv6 nodes to cache the binding
    of a mobile node's home address with its care-of address, and to then send any
    packets destined for the mobile node directly to it at this care-of address.  To
    support this operation, Mobile IPv6 defines a new IPv6 protocol and a new destination
    option.  All IPv6 nodes, whether mobile or stationary, can communicate with mobile
    nodes. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
