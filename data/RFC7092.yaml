abstract:
- content: "<p>In many SIP deployments, SIP entities exist in the SIP signaling path
    between the originating and final terminating endpoints, which go beyond the definition
    of a SIP proxy, performing functions not defined in Standards Track RFCs. The
    only term for such devices provided in RFC 3261 is for a Back-to-Back User Agent
    (B2BUA), which is defined as the logical concatenation of a SIP User Agent Server
    (UAS) and User Agent Client (UAC).</p><p>There are numerous types of SIP B2BUAs
    performing different roles in different ways; for example, IP Private Branch Exchanges
    (IPBXs), Session Border Controllers (SBCs), and Application Servers (ASs). This
    document identifies several common B2BUA roles in order to provide taxonomy other
    documents can use and reference.</p>"
