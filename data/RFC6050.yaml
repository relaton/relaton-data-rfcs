abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes private extensions to the Session Initiation
    Protocol (SIP) that enable a network of trusted SIP servers to assert the service
    of authenticated users. The use of these extensions is only applicable inside
    an administrative domain with previously agreed-upon policies for generation,
    transport, and usage of such information. This document does NOT offer a general
    service identification model suitable for use between different trust domains
    or for use in the Internet at large.</p><p>The document also defines a URN to
    identify both services and User Agent (UA) applications. This URN can be used
    within the SIP header fields defined in this document to identify services, and
    also within the framework defined for caller preferences and callee capabilities
    to identify usage of both services and applications between end UAs. This document
    is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational
    purposes.</p>"
