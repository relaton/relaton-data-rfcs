abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF Datatracker tool needs to be enhanced to make it possible
    for Working Group (WG) Chairs to provide IETF participants with more information
    about the status and progression of WG documents than is currently possible.</p><p>This
    document defines new states and status annotation tags that need to be added to
    the Datatracker to enable WG Chairs and their Delegates to track the status of
    Internet-Drafts (I-Ds) that are associated with their WGs. This document also
    describes the meaning of all previously implemented I-D states and substate annotation
    tags currently used by IETF Area Directors to indicate the status of I-Ds that
    have been sent to the IESG for evaluation and publication. This document is not
    an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
