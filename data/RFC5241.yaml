abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a new revenue source for the IETF to support
    standardization activities: protocol field naming rights, i.e., the association
    of commercial brands with protocol fields.  This memo describes a process for
    assignment of rights and explores some of the issues associated with the process.
    \ Individuals or organizations that wish to purchase naming rights for one or
    more protocol fields are expected to follow this process.  This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.</p>"
