abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is a report from the IRTF Host Identity Protocol (HIP)
    research group documenting the collective experiences and lessons learned from
    studies, related experimentation, and designs completed by the research group.
    \ The document summarizes implications of adding HIP to host protocol stacks,
    Internet infrastructure, and applications.  The perspective of a network operator,
    as well as a list of HIP experiments, are presented as well.  Portions of this
    report may be relevant also to other network overlay-based architectures or to
    attempts to deploy alternative networking architectures.  This document is not
    an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
