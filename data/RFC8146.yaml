abstract:
- content: "<p>EAP-pwd is an Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) method that
    utilizes a shared password for authentication using a technique that is resistant
    to dictionary attacks.  It includes support for raw keys and double hashing of
    a password in the style of Microsoft Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol
    version 2 (MSCHAPv2), but it does not include support for salted passwords.  There
    are many existing databases of salted passwords, and it is desirable to allow
    their use with EAP-pwd.</p>"
