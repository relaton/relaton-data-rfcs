abstract:
- content: <p>To provide Multicast VPN (MVPN) service, Provider Edge routers originate
    BGP Update messages that carry Multicast-VPN ("MCAST-VPN") BGP routes; they also
    originate unicast VPN routes that carry MVPN-specific attributes. These routes
    encode addresses from the customer's address space, as well as addresses from
    the provider's address space. These two address spaces are independent, and the
    address family (IPv4 or IPv6) of the two spaces may or may not be the same. These
    routes always contain an "address family" field that specifies whether the customer
    addresses are IPv4 addresses or whether they are IPv6 addresses. However, there
    is no field that explicitly specifies the address family of the provider addresses.
    To ensure interoperability, this document specifies that provider IPv4 addresses
    are always encoded in these update messages as 4-octet addresses, and that the
    distinction between IPv4 and IPv6 is signaled solely by the length of the address
    field. Specific cases are explained in detail. This document updates RFC 6514.
