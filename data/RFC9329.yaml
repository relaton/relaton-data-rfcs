abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes a method to transport Internet Key Exchange
    Protocol (IKE) and IPsec packets over a TCP connection for traversing network
    middleboxes that may block IKE negotiation over UDP. This method, referred to
    as "TCP encapsulation", involves sending both IKE packets for Security Association
    (SA) establishment and Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) packets over a TCP
    connection. This method is intended to be used as a fallback option when IKE cannot
    be negotiated over UDP.</p><p>TCP encapsulation for IKE and IPsec was defined
    in RFC 8229. This document clarifies the specification for TCP encapsulation by
    including additional clarifications obtained during implementation and deployment
    of this method. This documents obsoletes RFC 8229.</p>
