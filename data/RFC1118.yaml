abstract:
- content: <p>This RFC is being distributed to members of the Internet community in
    order to make available some "hints" which will allow new network participants
    to understand how the direction of the Internet is set, how to acquire online
    information and how to be a good Internet neighbor. While the information discussed
    may not be relevant to the research problems of the Internet, it may be interesting
    to a number of researchers and implementors. No standards are defined or specified
    in this memo.</p>
