abstract:
- content: "<p>IPv6 Neighbor Discovery includes Neighbor Unreachability Detection.
    \ That function is very useful when a host has an alternative neighbor -- for
    instance, when there are multiple default routers -- since it allows the host
    to switch to the alternative neighbor in a short time.  By default, this time
    is 3 seconds after the node starts probing.  However, if there are no alternative
    neighbors, this timeout behavior is far too impatient.  This document specifies
    relaxed rules for Neighbor Discovery retransmissions that allow an implementation
    to choose different timeout behavior based on whether or not there are alternative
    neighbors.  This document updates RFC 4861.</p>"
