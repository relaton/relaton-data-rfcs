abstract:
- content: "<p>Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) consists of a set
    of methods, headers, and content-types ancillary to HTTP/1.1 for the management
    of resource properties, creation and management of resource collections, URL namespace
    manipulation, and resource locking (collision avoidance).</p><p>RFC 2518 was published
    in February 1999, and this specification obsoletes RFC 2518 with minor revisions
    mostly due to interoperability experience. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
