abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF policies about Intellectual Property Rights (IPR), such as
    patent rights, relative to technologies developed in the IETF are designed to
    ensure that IETF working groups and participants have as much information about
    any IPR constraints on a technical proposal as possible.  The policies are also
    intended to benefit the Internet community and the public at large, while respecting
    the legitimate rights of IPR holders.  This memo details the IETF policies concerning
    IPR related to technology worked on within the IETF.  It also describes the objectives
    that the policies are designed to meet.  This memo updates RFC 2026 and, with
    RFC 3978, replaces Section 10 of RFC 2026.  This memo also updates paragraph 4
    of Section 3.2 of RFC 2028, for all purposes, including reference [2] in RFC 2418.
    \ This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet
    Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.</p>"
