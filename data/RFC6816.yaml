abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a fully specified simple Forward Error Correction
    (FEC) scheme for Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC) Staircase codes that can be used
    to protect media streams along the lines defined by FECFRAME. These codes have
    many interesting properties: they are systematic codes, they perform close to
    ideal codes in many use-cases, and they also feature very high encoding and decoding
    throughputs. LDPC-Staircase codes are therefore a good solution to protect a single
    high bitrate source flow or to protect globally several mid-rate flows within
    a single FECFRAME instance. They are also a good solution whenever the processing
    load of a software encoder or decoder must be kept to a minimum.</p>"
