abstract:
- content: <p>A DetNet (deterministic network) provides specific performance guarantees
    to its data flows, such as extremely low data loss rates and bounded latency (including
    bounded latency variation, i.e., "jitter"). As a result, securing a DetNet requires
    that in addition to the best practice security measures taken for any mission-critical
    network, additional security measures may be needed to secure the intended operation
    of these novel service properties.</p><p>This document addresses DetNet-specific
    security considerations from the perspectives of both the DetNet system-level
    designer and component designer. System considerations include a taxonomy of relevant
    threats and attacks, and associations of threats versus use cases and service
    properties. Component-level considerations include ingress filtering and packet
    arrival-time violation detection.</p><p>This document also addresses security
    considerations specific to the IP and MPLS data plane technologies, thereby complementing
    the Security Considerations sections of those documents.</p>
