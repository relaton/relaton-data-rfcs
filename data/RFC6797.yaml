abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines a mechanism enabling web sites to declare
    themselves accessible only via secure connections and/or for users to be able
    to direct their user agent(s) to interact with given sites only over secure connections.
    \ This overall policy is referred to as HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS).
    \ The policy is declared by web sites via the Strict-Transport-Security HTTP response
    header field and/or by other means, such as user agent configuration, for example.
