abstract:
- content: <p>The wide deployment of Voice over IP (VoIP), real-time text, and Video
    over IP services has introduced new challenges in managing and maintaining real-time
    voice/text/video quality, reliability, and overall performance.  In particular,
    media delivery is an area that needs attention.  One method of meeting these challenges
    is monitoring the media delivery performance by looping media back to the transmitter.  This
    is typically referred to as "active monitoring" of services.  Media loopback is
    especially popular in ensuring the quality of transport to the edge of a given
    VoIP, real-time text, or Video over IP service.  Today, in networks that deliver
    real-time media, short of running 'ping' and 'traceroute' to the edge, administrators
    are left without the necessary tools to actively monitor, manage, and diagnose
    quality issues with their service.  The extension defined herein adds new Session
    Description Protocol (SDP) media types and attributes that enable establishment
    of media sessions where the media is looped back to the transmitter.  Such media
    sessions will serve as monitoring and troubleshooting tools by providing the means
    for measurement of more advanced VoIP, real-time text, and Video over IP performance
    metrics.</p>
