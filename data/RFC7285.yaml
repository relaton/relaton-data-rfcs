abstract:
- content: "<p>Applications using the Internet already have access to some topology
    information of Internet Service Provider (ISP) networks. For example, views to
    Internet routing tables at Looking Glass servers are available and can be practically
    downloaded to many network application clients. What is missing is knowledge of
    the underlying network topologies from the point of view of ISPs. In other words,
    what an ISP prefers in terms of traffic optimization -- and a way to distribute
    it.</p><p>The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) services defined in
    this document provide network information (e.g., basic network location structure
    and preferences of network paths) with the goal of modifying network resource
    consumption patterns while maintaining or improving application performance. The
    basic information of ALTO is based on abstract maps of a network. These maps provide
    a simplified view, yet enough information about a network for applications to
    effectively utilize them. Additional services are built on top of the maps.</p><p>This
    document describes a protocol implementing the ALTO services. Although the ALTO
    services would primarily be provided by ISPs, other entities, such as content
    service providers, could also provide ALTO services. Applications that could use
    the ALTO services are those that have a choice to which end points to connect.
    Examples of such applications are peer-to-peer (P2P) and content delivery networks.</p>"
