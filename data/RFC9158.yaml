abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 7299 describes the object identifiers that were assigned by the
    Public Key Infrastructure using X.509 (PKIX) Working Group in an arc that was
    allocated by IANA (1.3.6.1.5.5.7).  A small number of object identifiers that
    were assigned in RFC 4212 are omitted from RFC 7299, and this document updates
    RFC 7299 to correct that oversight.</p>"
