abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides benchmarking terminology and methodology for
    next-generation network security devices, including next-generation firewalls
    (NGFWs) and next-generation intrusion prevention systems (NGIPSs). The main areas
    covered in this document are test terminology, test configuration parameters,
    and benchmarking methodology for NGFWs and NGIPSs. (It is assumed that readers
    have a working knowledge of these devices and the security functionality they
    contain.) This document aims to improve the applicability, reproducibility, and
    transparency of benchmarks and to align the test methodology with today's increasingly
    complex layer 7 security-centric network application use cases. As a result, this
    document makes RFC 3511 obsolete.</p>"
