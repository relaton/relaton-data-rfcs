abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a new protocol element, the Internationalized
    Resource Identifier (IRI), as a complement of the Uniform Resource Identifier
    (URI). An IRI is a sequence of characters from the Universal Character Set (Unicode/ISO
    10646). A mapping from IRIs to URIs is defined, which means that IRIs can be used
    instead of URIs, where appropriate, to identify resources.</p><p>The approach
    of defining a new protocol element was chosen instead of extending or changing
    the definition of URIs. This was done in order to allow a clear distinction and
    to avoid incompatibilities with existing software. Guidelines are provided for
    the use and deployment of IRIs in various protocols, formats, and software components
    that currently deal with URIs.</p>"
