abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a two-rate, three-color marker that has been
    in use for data services including Frame Relay services.  This marker can be used
    for metering per-flow traffic in the emerging IP and L2 VPN services.  The marker
    defined here is different from previously defined markers in the handling of the
    in-profile traffic.  Furthermore, this marker doesn't impose peak-rate shaping
    requirements on customer edge (CE) devices.  This memo provides information for
    the Internet community.</p>"
