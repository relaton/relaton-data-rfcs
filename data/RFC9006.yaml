abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides guidance on how to implement and use the Transmission
    Control Protocol (TCP) in Constrained-Node Networks (CNNs), which are a characteristic
    of the Internet of Things (IoT).  Such environments require a lightweight TCP
    implementation and may not make use of optional functionality.  This document
    explains a number of known and deployed techniques to simplify a TCP stack as
    well as corresponding trade-offs.  The objective is to help embedded developers
    with decisions on which TCP features to use.</p>"
