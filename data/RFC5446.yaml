abstract:
- content: "<p>In some Mobile IPv4 deployments, identifying the mobile node or the
    mobility service subscriber is not enough to distinguish among the multiple services
    possibly provisioned to the mobile node.  The capability to specify different
    services in addition to the mobile node's identity can be leveraged to provide
    flexibility for mobility service providers to provide multiple services within
    a single mobility service subscription.  This document describes a Service Selection
    extension for Mobile IPv4 that is intended to assist home agents to make specific
    service selections for their mobility service subscriptions during the registration
    procedure.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
