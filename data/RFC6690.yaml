abstract:
- content: <p>This specification defines Web Linking using a link format for use by
    constrained web servers to describe hosted resources, their attributes, and other
    relationships between links.  Based on the HTTP Link Header field defined in RFC
    5988, the Constrained RESTful Environments (CoRE) Link Format is carried as a
    payload and is assigned an Internet media type. "RESTful" refers to the Representational
    State Transfer (REST) architecture.  A well-known URI is defined as a default
    entry point for requesting the links hosted by a server. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
