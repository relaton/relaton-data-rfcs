abstract:
- content: "<p>The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is used in a large number of
    different application domains and environments.  This heterogeneity implies that
    different security mechanisms are needed to provide services such as confidentiality,
    integrity, and source authentication of RTP and RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) packets
    suitable for the various environments.  The range of solutions makes it difficult
    for RTP-based application developers to pick the most suitable mechanism.  This
    document provides an overview of a number of security solutions for RTP and gives
    guidance for developers on how to choose the appropriate security mechanism.</p>"
