abstract:
- content: "<p>The possibility of quantum computers poses a serious challenge to cryptographic
    algorithms deployed widely today. The Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2
    (IKEv2) is one example of a cryptosystem that could be broken; someone storing
    VPN communications today could decrypt them at a later time when a quantum computer
    is available. It is anticipated that IKEv2 will be extended to support quantum-secure
    key exchange algorithms; however, that is not likely to happen in the near term.
    To address this problem before then, this document describes an extension of IKEv2
    to allow it to be resistant to a quantum computer by using preshared keys.</p>"
