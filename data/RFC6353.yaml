abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a Transport Model for the Simple Network Management
    Protocol (SNMP), that uses either the Transport Layer Security protocol or the
    Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) protocol. The TLS and DTLS protocols
    provide authentication and privacy services for SNMP applications. This document
    describes how the TLS Transport Model (TLSTM) implements the needed features of
    an SNMP Transport Subsystem to make this protection possible in an interoperable
    way.</p><p>This Transport Model is designed to meet the security and operational
    needs of network administrators. It supports the sending of SNMP messages over
    TLS/TCP and DTLS/UDP. The TLS mode can make use of TCP's improved support for
    larger packet sizes and the DTLS mode provides potentially superior operation
    in environments where a connectionless (e.g., UDP) transport is preferred. Both
    TLS and DTLS integrate well into existing public keying infrastructures.</p><p>This
    document also defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use
    with network management protocols. In particular, it defines objects for managing
    the TLS Transport Model for SNMP. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
