abstract:
- content: "<p>The Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) DNS resource record
    (RR) provides a mechanism for domains to express the allowed set of Certification
    Authorities that are authorized to issue certificates for the domain. RFC 8659
    contains the core CAA specification, where Property Tags that restrict the issuance
    of certificates that certify domain names are defined. This specification defines
    a Property Tag that grants authorization to Certification Authorities to issue
    certificates that contain the key purpose in the extension and at least one value
    or value of type that includes the domain name in the extension.</p>"
