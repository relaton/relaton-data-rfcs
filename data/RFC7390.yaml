abstract:
- content: "<p>The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a specialized web transfer
    protocol for constrained devices and constrained networks.  It is anticipated
    that constrained devices will often naturally operate in groups (e.g., in a building
    automation scenario, all lights in a given room may need to be switched on/off
    as a group).  This specification defines how CoAP should be used in a group communication
    context.  An approach for using CoAP on top of IP multicast is detailed based
    on existing CoAP functionality as well as new features introduced in this specification.
    \ Also, various use cases and corresponding protocol flows are provided to illustrate
    important concepts.  Finally, guidance is provided for deployment in various network
    topologies.</p>"
