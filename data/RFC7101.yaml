abstract:
- content: <p>At one time, the RFC Editor published snapshots of the "Internet Official
    Protocol Standards".  These documents were known as xx00 documents, the last of
    which was published in May 2008.  These snapshots have been replaced by a web
    page, so the RFC Editor will no longer be publishing these snapshots as RFCs.  As
    a result, the RFC Editor will classify unpublished RFC xx00 numbers through 7000
    as never issued.  Starting with the RFC number 7100, xx00 numbers will be available
    for assignment.</p>
