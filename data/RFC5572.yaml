abstract:
- content: "<p>A tunnel broker with the Tunnel Setup Protocol (TSP) enables the establishment
    of tunnels of various inner protocols, such as IPv6 or IPv4, inside various outer
    protocols packets, such as IPv4, IPv6, or UDP over IPv4 for IPv4 NAT traversal.
    \ The control protocol (TSP) is used by the tunnel client to negotiate the tunnel
    with the broker.  A mobile node implementing TSP can be connected to both IPv4
    and IPv6 networks whether it is on IPv4 only, IPv4 behind a NAT, or on IPv6 only.
    \ A tunnel broker may terminate the tunnels on remote tunnel servers or on itself.
    \ This document describes the TSP within the model of the tunnel broker model.
    \ This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</p>"
