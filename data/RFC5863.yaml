abstract:
- content: <p>DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) allows an organization to claim responsibility
    for transmitting a message, in a way that can be validated by a recipient. The
    organization can be the author's, the originating sending site, an intermediary,
    or one of their agents. A message can contain multiple signatures, from the same
    or different organizations involved with the message. DKIM defines a domain-level
    digital signature authentication framework for email, using public key cryptography
    and using the domain name service as its key server technology. This permits verification
    of a responsible organization, as well as the integrity of the message content.
    DKIM will also provide a mechanism that permits potential email signers to publish
    information about their email signing practices; this will permit email receivers
    to make additional assessments about messages. DKIM's authentication of email
    identity can assist in the global control of "spam" and "phishing". This document
    provides implementation, deployment, operational, and migration considerations
    for DKIM. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is
    published for informational purposes.</p>
