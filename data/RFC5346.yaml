abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes experiences of operational requirements and
    several considerations for ENUM-based softswitches concerning call routing between
    two Korean Voice over IP (VoIP) carriers, gained during the ENUM pre-commercial
    trial hosted by the National Internet Development Agency of Korea (NIDA) in 2006.</p><p>These
    experiences show that an interim solution can maintain the stability of ongoing
    commercial softswitch system operations during the initial stage of ENUM service,
    where the DNS does not have sufficient data for the majority of calls. This memo
    provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
