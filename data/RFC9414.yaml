abstract:
- content: <p>This document analyzes the timeline of the specification and implementation
    of different types of "transient numeric identifiers" used in IETF protocols and
    how the security and privacy properties of such protocols have been affected as
    a result of it. It provides empirical evidence that advice in this area is warranted.
    This document is a product of the Privacy Enhancements and Assessments Research
    Group (PEARG) in the IRTF.</p>
