abstract:
- content: "<p>The following is the description of a TELNET option designed to facilitate
    double login avoidance.  It is intended primarily for TAC connections to target
    hosts on behalf of TAC users, but it can be used between any two consenting hosts.
    \ For example, all hosts at one site (e.g., BBN) can use this option to avoid
    double login when TELNETing to one another.  This RFC suggests a proposed protocol
    for the ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.</p>"
