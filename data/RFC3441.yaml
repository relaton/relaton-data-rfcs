abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) package
    for the Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP).  This package includes new Local
    Connection Options, ATM-specific events and signals, and ATM connection parameters.
    \ Also included is a description of codec and profile negotiation.  It extends
    the MGCP that is currently being deployed in a number of products.  Implementers
    should be aware of developments in the IETF Megaco Working Group and ITU SG16,
    which are currently working on a potential successor to this protocol.  This memo
    provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
