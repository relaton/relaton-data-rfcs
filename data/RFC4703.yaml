abstract:
- content: "<p>The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) provides a mechanism
    for host configuration that includes dynamic assignment of IP addresses and fully
    qualified domain names.  To maintain accurate name-to-IP-address and IP-address-to-name
    mappings in the DNS, these dynamically assigned addresses and fully qualified
    domain names (FQDNs) require updates to the DNS.  This document identifies situations
    in which conflicts in the use of fully qualified domain names may arise among
    DHCP clients and servers, and it describes a strategy for the use of the DHCID
    DNS resource record (RR) in resolving those conflicts. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
