abstract:
- content: "<p>We are approaching the time when we will be able to communicate faster
    than the speed of light.  It is well known that as we approach the speed of light,
    time slows down.  Logically, it is reasonable to assume that as we go faster than
    the speed of light, time will reverse.  The major consequence of this for Internet
    protocols is that packets will arrive before they are sent.  This will have a
    major impact on the way we design Internet protocols.  This paper outlines some
    of the issues and suggests some directions for additional analysis of these issues.</p>"
