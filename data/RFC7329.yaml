abstract:
- content: "<p>There is a need for having a globally unique session identifier for
    the same SIP session that can be consistently maintained across SIP Proxies, Back-to-Back
    User Agents (B2BUAs), and other SIP middleboxes, for the purpose of troubleshooting.
    This document proposes a new SIP header to carry such a value: Session-ID.</p><p>The
    mechanism defined in this document has been widely deployed, and is being followed
    in a backward-compatible fashion for a new Standards Track document produced by
    the INSIPID Working Group.</p>"
