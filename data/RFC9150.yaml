abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the use of cipher suites for TLS 1.3 based on
    Hashed Message Authentication Code (HMAC).  Using these cipher suites provides
    server and, optionally, mutual authentication and data authenticity, but not data
    confidentiality.  Cipher suites with these properties are not of general applicability,
    but there are use cases, specifically in Internet of Things (IoT) and constrained
    environments, that do not require confidentiality of exchanged messages while
    still requiring integrity protection, server authentication, and optional client
    authentication.  This document gives examples of such use cases, with the caveat
    that prior to using these integrity-only cipher suites, a threat model for the
    situation at hand is needed, and a threat analysis must be performed within that
    model to determine whether the use of integrity-only cipher suites is appropriate.
    \ The approach described in this document is not endorsed by the IETF and does
    not have IETF consensus, but it is presented here to enable interoperable implementation
    of a reduced-security mechanism that provides authentication and message integrity
    without supporting confidentiality.</p>"
