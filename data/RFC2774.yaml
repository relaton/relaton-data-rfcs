abstract:
- content: "<p>A wide range of applications have proposed various extensions of the
    HTTP protocol.  Current efforts span an enormous range, including distributed
    authoring, collaboration, printing, and remote procedure call mechanisms.  These
    HTTP extensions are not coordinated, since there has been no standard framework
    for defining extensions and thus, separation of concerns.  This document describes
    a generic extension mechanism for HTTP, which is designed to address the tension
    between private agreement and public specification and to accommodate extension
    of applications using HTTP clients, servers, and proxies.  The proposal associates
    each extension with a globally unique identifier, and uses HTTP header fields
    to carry the extension identifier and related information between the parties
    involved in the extended communication.</p>"
