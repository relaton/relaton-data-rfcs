abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification describes the NSIS Signaling Layer Protocol (NSLP)
    for signaling Quality of Service (QoS) reservations in the Internet.  It is in
    accordance with the framework and requirements developed in NSIS.  Together with
    General Internet Signaling Transport (GIST), it provides functionality similar
    to RSVP and extends it.  The QoS NSLP is independent of the underlying QoS specification
    or architecture and provides support for different reservation models.  It is
    simplified by the elimination of support for multicast flows.  This specification
    explains the overall protocol approach, describes the design decisions made, and
    provides examples.  It specifies object, message formats, and processing rules.
    \ This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</p>"
