abstract:
- content: <p>The purpose of this memo is to document how the requirements for publication
    of a routing protocol as an Internet Draft Standard have been satisfied by Border
    Gateway Protocol version 4 (BGP-4).</p><p>This report satisfies the requirement
    for "the second report", as described in Section 6.0 of RFC 1264. In order to
    fulfill the requirement, this report augments RFC 1773 and describes additional
    knowledge and understanding gained in the time between when the protocol was made
    a Draft Standard and when it was submitted for Standard. This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.</p>
