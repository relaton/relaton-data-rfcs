abstract:
- content: <p>Different routing protocols employ different mechanisms for securing
    protocol packets on the wire.  While most already have some method for accomplishing
    cryptographic message authentication, in many cases the existing methods are dated,
    vulnerable to attack, and employ cryptographic algorithms that have been deprecated.  The
    "Keying and Authentication for Routing Protocols" (KARP) effort aims to overhaul
    and improve these mechanisms.  This document does not contain protocol specifications.  Instead,
    it defines the areas where protocol specification work is needed.  This document
    is a companion document to RFC 6518, "Keying and Authentication for Routing Protocols
    (KARP) Design Guidelines"; together they form the guidance and instruction KARP
    design teams will use to review and overhaul routing protocol transport security.</p>
