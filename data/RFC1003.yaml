- content: "<p>This memo is intended to identify and explore issues in defining a
    standard for the exchange of mathematical equations.  No attempt is made at a
    complete definition and more questions are asked than are answered.  Questions
    about the user interface are only addressed to the extent that they affect interchange
    issues.</p>"
