abstract:
- content: '<p>"Differentiated Services (Diffserv)-aware MPLS Traffic Engineering
    Requirements", RFC 3564, specifies the requirements and selection criteria for
    Bandwidth Constraints Models.  Two such models, the Maximum Allocation and the
    Russian Dolls, are described therein.  This document complements RFC 3564 by presenting
    the results of a performance evaluation of these two models under various operational
    conditions: normal load, overload, preemption fully or partially enabled, pure
    blocking, or complete sharing.  This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.</p>'
