abstract:
- content: "<p>In recent years, there has been a shift in wireless LAN (WLAN) product
    architectures from autonomous access points to centralized control of lightweight
    access points. The general goal has been to move most of the traditional wireless
    functionality such as access control (user authentication and authorization),
    mobility, and radio management out of the access point into a centralized controller.</p><p>The
    IETF's CAPWAP (Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points) WG has identified
    that a standards-based protocol is necessary between a wireless Access Controller
    and Wireless Termination Points (the latter are also commonly referred to as Lightweight
    Access Points). This specification defines the Lightweight Access Point Protocol
    (LWAPP), which addresses the CAPWAP's (Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access
    Points) protocol requirements. Although the LWAPP protocol is designed to be flexible
    enough to be used for a variety of wireless technologies, this specific document
    describes the base protocol and an extension that allows it to be used with the
    IEEE's 802.11 wireless LAN protocol. This document defines a Historic Document
    for the Internet community.</p>"
