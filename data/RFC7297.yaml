abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Connectivity Provisioning Profile (CPP)
    and proposes a CPP template to capture IP/MPLS connectivity requirements to be
    met within a service delivery context (e.g., Voice over IP or IP TV). The CPP
    defines the set of IP transfer parameters to be supported by the underlying transport
    network together with a reachability scope and bandwidth/capacity needs. Appropriate
    performance metrics, such as one-way delay or one-way delay variation, are used
    to characterize an IP transfer service. Both global and restricted reachability
    scopes can be captured in the CPP.</p><p>Such a generic CPP template is meant
    to (1) facilitate the automation of the service negotiation and activation procedures,
    thus accelerating service provisioning, (2) set (traffic) objectives of Traffic
    Engineering functions and service management functions, and (3) improve service
    and network management systems with 'decision- making' capabilities based upon
    negotiated/offered CPPs.</p>"
