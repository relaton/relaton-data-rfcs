abstract:
- content: <p>The motivation and use cases for interworking and transporting User-
    to-User Information (UUI) from the ITU-T Digital Subscriber Signalling System
    No. 1 (DSS1) User-user information element within SIP are described in RFC 6567.
    As networks move to SIP, it is important that applications requiring this data
    can continue to function in SIP networks as well as have the ability to interwork
    with this ISDN service for end-to-end transparency. This document defines a usage
    (a new package called the ISDN UUI package) of the User-to-User header field to
    enable interworking with this ISDN service.</p><p>This document covers interworking
    with both public ISDN and private ISDN capabilities, so the potential interworking
    with QSIG will also be addressed.</p><p>The package is identified by the new value
    "isdn-uui" of the "purpose" header field parameter.</p>
