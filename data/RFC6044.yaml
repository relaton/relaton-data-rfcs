abstract:
- content: "<p>Although the SIP History-Info header is the solution adopted in IETF,
    the non-standard Diversion header is nevertheless widely implemented and used
    for conveying call-diversion-related information in SIP signaling.</p><p>This
    document describes a recommended interworking guideline between the Diversion
    header and the History-Info header to handle call diversion information. In addition,
    an interworking policy is proposed to manage the headers' coexistence. The History-Info
    header is described in RFC 4244 and the non-standard Diversion header is described,
    as Historic, in RFC 5806.</p><p>Since the Diversion header is used in many existing
    network implementations for the transport of call diversion information, its interworking
    with the SIP History-Info standardized solution is needed. This work is intended
    to enable the migration from non- standard implementations and deployment toward
    IETF specification- based implementations and deployment. This document is not
    an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
