abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies properties and characteristics of a Lower-
    Effort Per-Hop Behavior (LE PHB). The primary objective of this LE PHB is to protect
    Best-Effort (BE) traffic (packets forwarded with the default PHB) from LE traffic
    in congestion situations, i.e., when resources become scarce, BE traffic has precedence
    over LE traffic and may preempt it. Alternatively, packets forwarded by the LE
    PHB can be associated with a scavenger service class, i.e., they scavenge otherwise-unused
    resources only. There are numerous uses for this PHB, e.g., for background traffic
    of low precedence, such as bulk data transfers with low priority in time, non-time-critical
    backups, larger software updates, web search engines while gathering information
    from web servers and so on. This document recommends a standard Differentiated
    Services Code Point (DSCP) value for the LE PHB.</p><p>This specification obsoletes
    RFC 3662 and updates the DSCP recommended in RFCs 4594 and 8325 to use the DSCP
    assigned in this specification.</p>"
