abstract:
- content: "<p>There is an emerging demand for solutions that provide redundancy and
    load-sharing across wired and cellular links from a single Service Provider, so
    that a single subscriber is provided with bonded access to heterogeneous connections
    at the same time.</p><p>In this document, GRE (Generic Routing Encapsulation)
    Tunnel Bonding is specified as an enabling approach for bonded access to a wired
    and a wireless network in customer premises, e.g., homes. In GRE Tunnel Bonding,
    two GRE tunnels, one per network connection, are set up and bonded together to
    form a single GRE tunnel for a subscriber. Compared with each subconnection, the
    bonded connections promise increased access capacity and improved reliability.
    The solution described in this document is currently implemented by Huawei and
    deployed by Deutsche Telekom AG. This document will enable other developers to
    build interoperable implementations.</p>"
