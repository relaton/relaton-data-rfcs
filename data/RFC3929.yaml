abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes an experimental set of alternative decision-making
    processes for use in IETF working groups.  There are a small number of cases in
    IETF working groups in which the group has come to consensus that a particular
    decision must be made but cannot agree on the decision itself.  This document
    describes alternative mechanisms for reaching a decision in those cases.  This
    is not meant to provide an exhaustive list, but to provide a known set of tools
    that can be used when needed.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for
    the Internet community.</p>"
