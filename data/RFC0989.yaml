abstract:
- content: "<p>This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the Internet community and
    requests discussion and suggestions for improvements. This RFC is the outgrowth
    of a series of IAB Privacy Task Force meetings and of internal working papers
    distributed for those meetings. This RFC defines message encipherment and authentication
    procedures, as the initial phase of an effort to provide privacy enhancement services
    for electronic mail transfer in the Internet. It is intended that the procedures
    defined here be compatible with a wide range of key management approaches, including
    both conventional (symmetric) and public-key (asymmetric) approaches for encryption
    of data encrypting keys. Use of conventional cryptography for message text encryption
    and/or authentication is anticipated.</p>"
