abstract:
- content: "<p>Watchers are defined as entities that request (i.e., subscribe to)
    information about a resource.  There is fairly complex state associated with these
    subscriptions.  The union of the state for all subscriptions to a particular resource
    is called the watcher information for that resource.  This state is dynamic, changing
    as subscribers come and go.  As a result, it is possible, and indeed useful, to
    subscribe to the watcher information for a particular resource.  In order to enable
    this, a format is needed to describe the state of watchers on a resource.  This
    specification describes an Extensible Markup Language (XML) document format for
    such state. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
