abstract:
- content: "<p>Although the DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) have been under development
    for most of the last decade, the IETF has never written down the specific set
    of threats against which DNSSEC is designed to protect. Among other drawbacks,
    this cart-before-the-horse situation has made it difficult to determine whether
    DNSSEC meets its design goals, since its design goals are not well specified.
    This note attempts to document some of the known threats to the DNS, and, in doing
    so, attempts to measure to what extent (if any) DNSSEC is a useful tool in defending
    against these threats. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
