abstract:
- content: <p>This is the specification of the Telnet protocol used for remote terminal
    access in the ARPA Internet.  The purpose of the TELNET Protocol is to provide
    a fairly general, bi-directional, eight-bit byte oriented communications facility.  Its
    primary goal is to allow a standard method of interfacing terminal devices and
    terminal-oriented processes to each other.  It is envisioned that the protocol
    may also be used for terminal-terminal communication ("linking") and process-process
    communication (distributed computation).  This RFC specifies a standard for the
    ARPA Internet community.  Hosts on the ARPA Internet are expected to adopt and
    implement this standard.  Obsoletes NIC 18639.</p>
