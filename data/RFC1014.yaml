abstract:
- content: "<p>XDR is a standard for the description and encoding of data.  It is
    useful for transferring data between different computer architectures.  XDR fits
    into ISO presentation layer, and is roughly analogous in purpose to X.409, ISO
    Abstract Syntax Notation.  The major difference between these two is that XDR
    uses implicit typing, while X.409 uses explicit typing.  This RFC is distributed
    for information only, it does not establish a Internet standard.</p>"
