abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines extensions to the Mobile IP protocol for
    allowing a mobile node with multiple interfaces to register a care-of address
    for each of its network interfaces and to simultaneously establish multiple IP
    tunnels with its home agent.  This essentially allows the mobile node to utilize
    all the available network interfaces and build a higher aggregated logical pipe
    with its home agent for its home address traffic.  Furthermore, these extensions
    also allow the mobile node and the home agent to negotiate IP traffic flow policies
    for binding individual flows with the registered care-of addresses.</p>"
