abstract:
- content: <p>This memo discusses policies that require certain labels to be inserted
    in the "Subject:" header of a mail message.  Such policies are difficult to specify
    accurately while remaining compliant with key RFCs and are likely to be ineffective
    at best.  This memo discusses an alternate, \%standards-compliant approach that
    is significantly simpler to specify and is somewhat less likely to be ineffective.  This
    memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>
