abstract:
- content: "<p>A number of the candidates for IPng have some features that are somewhat
    worrisome from a security perspective.  While it is not necessary that IPng be
    an improvement over IPv4, it is mandatory that it not make things worse.  This
    memo provides information for the Internet community.  This memo does not specify
    an Internet standard of any kind.</p>"
