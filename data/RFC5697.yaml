abstract:
- content: "<p>Some applications that associate state information with public key
    certificates can benefit from a way to link together a set of certificates that
    belong to the same end entity and that can safely be considered equivalent to
    one another for the purposes of referencing that application-state information.
    This memo defines a certificate extension that allows applications to establish
    the required linkage without introducing a new application protocol data unit.
    This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</p>"
