    has been chartered to work on routing solutions for Low-Power and Lossy Networks
    (LLNs) in various markets: industrial, commercial (building), home, and urban
    networks.  Pursuant to this effort, this document defines the IPv6 routing requirements
    for building automation.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;
