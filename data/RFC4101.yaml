abstract:
- content: <p>The IETF process depends on peer review. However, IETF documents are
    generally written to be useful for implementors, not reviewers. In particular,
    while great care is generally taken to provide a complete description of the state
    machines and bits on the wire, this level of detail tends to get in the way of
    initial understanding. This document describes an approach for providing protocol
    "models" that allow reviewers to quickly grasp the essence of a system. This memo
    provides information for the Internet community.</p>
