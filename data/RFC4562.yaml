abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes a mechanism to ensure layer-2 separation of
    Local Area Network (LAN) stations accessing an IPv4 gateway over a bridged Ethernet
    segment.</p><p>The mechanism - called "MAC-Forced Forwarding" - implements an
    Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) proxy function that prohibits Ethernet Media
    Access Control (MAC) address resolution between hosts located within the same
    IPv4 subnet but at different customer premises, and in effect directs all upstream
    traffic to an IPv4 gateway. The IPv4 gateway provides IP-layer connectivity between
    these same hosts. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>
