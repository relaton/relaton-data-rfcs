abstract:
- content: <p>This document summarizes the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
    - Internet Society (ISOC) relationship, following a major revision to the structure
    of the IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA) in 2018.  The IASA was revised
    under a new "IASA 2.0" structure by the IASA2 Working Group, which changed the
    IETF's administrative, legal, and financial structure.  As a result, it also changed
    the relationship between the IETF and ISOC, which made it necessary to revise
    RFC 2031.</p>
