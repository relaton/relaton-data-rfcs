abstract:
- content: <p>During IETF meetings, individual volunteers often help sessions run
    more smoothly by relaying information back and forth between the physical meeting
    room and an associated textual chatroom.  Such volunteers are commonly called
    "Jabber scribes".  This document summarizes experience with the Jabber scribe
    role and provides some suggestions for fulfilling the role at IETF meetings.</p>
