abstract:
- content: "<p>Enterprise network administrators worldwide are in various stages of
    preparing for or deploying IPv6 into their networks.  The administrators face
    different challenges than operators of Internet access providers and have reasons
    for different priorities.  The overall problem for many administrators will be
    to offer Internet- facing services over IPv6 while continuing to support IPv4,
    and while introducing IPv6 access within the enterprise IT network.  The overall
    transition will take most networks from an IPv4-only environment to a dual-stack
    network environment and eventually an IPv6-only operating mode.  This document
    helps provide a framework for enterprise network architects or administrators
    who may be faced with many of these challenges as they consider their IPv6 support
    strategies.</p>"
