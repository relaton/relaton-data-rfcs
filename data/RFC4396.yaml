abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an RTP payload format for the transmission
    of 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project) timed text.  3GPP timed text is a
    time-lined, decorated text media format with defined storage in a 3GP file.  Timed
    Text can be synchronized with audio/video contents and used in applications such
    as captioning, titling, and multimedia presentations.  In the following sections,
    the problems of streaming timed text are addressed, and a payload format for streaming
    3GPP timed text over RTP is specified. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
