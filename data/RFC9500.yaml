abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a set of standard Public Key Cryptography (PKC)
    test keys that may be used wherever pre-generated keys and associated operations
    like digital signatures are required. Like the European Institute for Computer
    Antivirus Research (EICAR) virus test and the Generic Test for Unsolicited Bulk
    Email (GTUBE) spam test files, these publicly known test keys can be detected
    and recognised by applications consuming them as being purely for testing purposes
    without assigning any security properties to them.</p>"
