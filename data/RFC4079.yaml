abstract:
- content: "<p>GEOPRIV defines the concept of a 'using protocol' -- a protocol that
    carries GEOPRIV location objects. GEOPRIV also defines various scenarios for the
    distribution of location objects that require the concepts of subscriptions and
    asynchronous notifications. This document examines some existing IETF work on
    the concept of presence, shows how presence architectures map onto GEOPRIV architectures,
    and moreover demonstrates that tools already developed for presence could be reused
    to simplify the standardization and implementation of GEOPRIV. This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.</p>"
