abstract:
- content: "<p>TLS session tickets enable stateless connection resumption for clients
    without server-side, per-client state.  Servers vend an arbitrary number of session
    tickets to clients, at their discretion, upon connection establishment.  Clients
    store and use tickets when resuming future connections.  This document describes
    a mechanism by which clients can specify the desired number of tickets needed
    for future connections.  This extension aims to provide a means for servers to
    determine the number of tickets to generate in order to reduce ticket waste while
    simultaneously priming clients for future connection attempts.</p>"
