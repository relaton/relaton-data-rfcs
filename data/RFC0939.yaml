abstract:
- content: <p>This RFC reproduces the material from the "front pages" of the National
    Research Council report resulting from a study of the DOD Internet Protocol (IP)
    and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) in comparison with the ISO Internet Protocol
    (ISO-IP) and Transport Protocol level 4 (TP-4).  The point of this RFC is to make
    the text of the Executive Summary widely available in a timely way.  The order
    of presentation has been altered, and the pagination changed.  This RFC is distributed
    for information only.  This RFC does not establish any policy for the DARPA research
    community or the DDN operational community.</p>
