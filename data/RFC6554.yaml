abstract:
- content: "<p>In Low-Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs), memory constraints on routers
    may limit them to maintaining, at most, a few routes.  In some configurations,
    it is necessary to use these memory-constrained routers to deliver datagrams to
    nodes within the LLN.  The Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL)
    can be used in some deployments to store most, if not all, routes on one (e.g.,
    the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) root) or a few routers and forward the IPv6 datagram
    using a source routing technique to avoid large routing tables on memory-constrained
    routers.  This document specifies a new IPv6 Routing header type for delivering
    datagrams within a RPL routing domain. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
