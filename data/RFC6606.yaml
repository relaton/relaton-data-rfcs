abstract:
- content: "<p>IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPANs) are
    formed by devices that are compatible with the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. However,
    neither the IEEE 802.15.4 standard nor the 6LoWPAN format specification defines
    how mesh topologies could be obtained and maintained. Thus, it should be considered
    how 6LoWPAN formation and multi-hop routing could be supported.</p><p>This document
    provides the problem statement and design space for 6LoWPAN routing. It defines
    the routing requirements for 6LoWPANs, considering the low-power and other particular
    characteristics of the devices and links. The purpose of this document is not
    to recommend specific solutions but to provide general, layer-agnostic guidelines
    about the design of 6LoWPAN routing that can lead to further analysis and protocol
    design. This document is intended as input to groups working on routing protocols
    relevant to 6LoWPANs, such as the IETF ROLL WG. This document is not an Internet
    Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
