abstract:
- content: "<p>Over the many years since the introduction of the Internet Protocol,
    we have seen a number of transitions throughout the protocol stack, such as deploying
    a new protocol, or updating or replacing an existing protocol.  Many protocols
    and technologies were not designed to enable smooth transition to alternatives
    or to easily deploy extensions; thus, some transitions, such as the introduction
    of IPv6, have been difficult.  This document attempts to summarize some basic
    principles to enable future transitions, and it also summarizes what makes for
    a good transition plan.</p>"
