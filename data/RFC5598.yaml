abstract:
- content: "<p>Over its thirty-five-year history, Internet Mail has changed significantly
    in scale and complexity, as it has become a global infrastructure service.  These
    changes have been evolutionary, rather than revolutionary, reflecting a strong
    desire to preserve both its installed base and its usefulness.  To collaborate
    productively on this large and complex system, all participants need to work from
    a common view of it and use a common language to describe its components and the
    interactions among them.  But the many differences in perspective currently make
    it difficult to know exactly what another participant means.  To serve as the
    necessary common frame of reference, this document describes the enhanced Internet
    Mail architecture, reflecting the current service.  This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.</p>"
