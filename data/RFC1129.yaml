abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes the Network Time Protocol (NTP) designed to distribute
    time information in a large, diverse internet system operating at speeds from
    mundane to lightwave. It uses a returnable- time architecture in which a distributed
    subnet of time servers operating in a self-organizing, hierarchical, master-slave
    configuration synchronizes local clocks within the subnet and to national time
    standards via wire or radio. The servers can also redistribute time information
    within a network via local routing algorithms and time daemons. The architectures,
    algorithms and protocols which have evolved to NTP over several years of implementation
    and refinement are described in this paper. The synchronization subnet which has
    been in regular operation in the Internet for the last several years is described
    along with performance data which shows that timekeeping accuracy throughout most
    portions of the Internet can be ordinarily maintained to within a few tens of
    milliseconds, even in cases of failure or disruption of clocks, time servers or
    networks. This memo describes the Network Time Protocol in RFC-1119.</p>"
