abstract:
- content: "<p>Electronic commerce frequently requires a substantial exchange of information
    in order to complete a purchase or other transaction, especially the first time
    the parties communicate.  A standard set of hierarchically-organized payment-related
    information field names in an XML syntax is defined so that this task can be more
    easily automated.  This is the second version of an Electronic Commerce Modeling
    Language (ECML) and is intended to meet the requirements of RFC 3505. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
