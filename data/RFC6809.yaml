abstract:
- content: <p>This specification defines a new SIP header field, Feature-Caps. The
    Feature-Caps header field conveys feature-capability indicators that are used
    to indicate support of features and capabilities for SIP entities that are not
    represented by the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) of the Contact header field.</p><p>SIP
    entities that are represented by the URI of the SIP Contact header field can convey
    media feature tags in the Contact header field to indicate support of features
    and capabilities.</p><p>This specification also defines feature-capability indicators
    and creates a new IANA registry, "Proxy-Feature Feature-Capability Indicator Trees",
    for registering feature-capability indicators. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
