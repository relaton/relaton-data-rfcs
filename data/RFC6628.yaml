abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an efficient augmented password-only authentication
    and key exchange (AugPAKE) protocol where a user remembers a low-entropy password
    and its verifier is registered in the intended server.  In general, the user password
    is chosen from a small set of dictionary words that allows an attacker to perform
    exhaustive searches (i.e., off-line dictionary attacks).  The AugPAKE protocol
    described here is secure against passive attacks, active attacks, and off-line
    dictionary attacks (on the obtained messages with passive/active attacks), and
    also provides resistance to server compromise (in the context of augmented PAKE
    security).  In addition, this document describes how the AugPAKE protocol is integrated
    into the Internet Key Exchange Protocol version 2 (IKEv2).  This document defines
    an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</p>"
