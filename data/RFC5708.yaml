abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes X.509 key identifiers and signature encoding for
    version 2 of the KeyNote trust-management system (RFC 2704). X.509 certificates
    (RFC 5280) can be directly used in the Authorizer or Licensees field (or in both
    fields) in a KeyNote assertion, allowing for easy integration with protocols that
    already use X.509 certificates for authentication.</p><p>In addition, the document
    defines additional signature types that use other hash functions (beyond the MD5
    and SHA1 hash functions that are defined in RFC 2792). This document is not an
    Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
