abstract:
- content: "<p>This RFC suggests a simple method for workstations to dynamically access
    mail from a mailbox server.  The intent of the Post Office Protocol (POP) is to
    allow a user's workstation to access mail from a mailbox server.  It is expected
    that mail will be posted from the workstation to the mailbox server via the Simple
    Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP).  This RFC specifies a proposed protocol for the
    ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvement.
    \ The status of this protocol is experimental, and this protocol is dependent
    upon TCP.</p>"
