abstract:
- content: "<p>Email has become a popular distribution service for a variety of socially
    unacceptable, mass-effect purposes. The most obvious ones include spam and worms.
    This note recommends conventions for the operation of email submission and transport
    services between independent operators, such as enterprises and Internet Service
    Providers. Its goal is to improve lines of accountability for controlling abusive
    uses of the Internet mail service. To this end, this document offers recommendations
    for constructive operational policies between independent operators of email submission
    and transmission services.</p><p>Email authentication technologies are aimed at
    providing assurances and traceability between internetworked networks. In many
    email services, the weakest link in the chain of assurances is initial submission
    of a message. This document offers recommendations for constructive operational
    policies for this first step of email sending, the submission (or posting) of
    email into the transmission network. Relaying and delivery entail policies that
    occur subsequent to submission and are outside the scope of this document. This
    document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community,
    and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.</p>"
