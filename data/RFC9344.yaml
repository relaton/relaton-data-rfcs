abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes a mechanism named "CCNinfo" that discovers information
    about the network topology and in-network cache in Content-Centric Networks (CCNs).
    CCNinfo investigates 1) the CCN routing path information per name prefix, 2) the
    Round-Trip Time (RTT) between the content forwarder and the consumer, and 3) the
    states of in-network cache per name prefix. CCNinfo is useful to understand and
    debug the behavior of testbed networks and other experimental deployments of CCN
    systems.</p><p>This document is a product of the IRTF Information-Centric Networking
    Research Group (ICNRG). This document represents the consensus view of ICNRG and
    has been reviewed extensively by several members of the ICN community and the
    RG. The authors and RG chairs approve of the contents. The document is sponsored
    under the IRTF, is not issued by the IETF, and is not an IETF standard. This is
    an experimental protocol and the specification may change in the future.</p>
