abstract:
- content: "<p>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is increasingly being used in
    systems that are tightly coupled with Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP) servers
    for a variety of reasons.  In many of these cases, applications can benefit from
    being able to discover, in near real- time, when a specific HTTP resource is created,
    changed, or deleted.  This document proposes a mechanism, based on the SIP Event
    Framework, for doing so. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
