abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes a means for automated, authenticated, and authorized
    updating of DNSSEC "trust anchors". The method provides protection against N-1
    key compromises of N keys in the trust point key set. Based on the trust established
    by the presence of a current anchor, other anchors may be added at the same place
    in the hierarchy, and, ultimately, supplant the existing anchor(s).</p><p>This
    mechanism will require changes to resolver management behavior (but not resolver
    resolution behavior), and the addition of a single flag bit to the DNSKEY record.
