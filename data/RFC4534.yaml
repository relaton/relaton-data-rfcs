abstract:
- content: "<p>The Group Security Policy Token is a structure used to specify the
    security policy and configurable parameters for a cryptographic group, such as
    a secure multicast group.  Because the security of a group is composed of the
    totality of multiple security services, mechanisms, and attributes throughout
    the communications infrastructure, an authenticatable representation of the features
    that must be supported throughout the system is needed to ensure consistent security.
    \ This document specifies the structure of such a token. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
