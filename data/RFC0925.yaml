abstract:
- content: '<p>The problem of treating a set of local area networks (LANs) as one
    Internet network has generated some interest and concern. It is inappropriate
    to give each LAN within an site a distinct Internet network number. It is desirable
    to hide the details of the interconnections between the LANs within an site from
    people, gateways, and hosts outside the site. The question arises on how to best
    do this, and even how to do it at all. In RFC-917 Jeffery Mogul makes a case for
    the use of "explicit subnets" in a multi-LAN environment. The explicit subnet
    scheme is a call to recursively apply the mechanisms the Internet uses to manage
    networks to the problem of managing LANs within one network. In this note I urge
    another approach: the use of "transparent subnets" supported by a multi-LAN extension
    of the Address Resolution Protocol. This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for
    the ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.</p>'
