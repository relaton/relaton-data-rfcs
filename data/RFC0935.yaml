abstract:
- content: "<p>This RFC discusses protocols proposed recently in RFCs 914 and 916,
    and suggests a proposed protocol that could meet the same needs addressed in those
    memos.  The stated need is reliable communication between two programs over a
    full-duplex, point-to-point communication link, and in particular the RFCs address
    the need for such communication over an asynchronous link at relatively low speeds.
    \ The suggested protocol uses the methods of existing national and international
    data link layer standards.  This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the ARPA-Internet
    community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.</p>"
