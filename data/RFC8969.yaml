abstract:
- content: "<p>Data models provide a programmatic approach to represent services and
    networks. Concretely, they can be used to derive configuration information for
    network and service components, and state information that will be monitored and
    tracked. Data models can be used during the service and network management life
    cycle (e.g., service instantiation, service provisioning, service optimization,
    service monitoring, service diagnosing, and service assurance). Data models are
    also instrumental in the automation of network management, and they can provide
    closed-loop control for adaptive and deterministic service creation, delivery,
    and maintenance.</p><p>This document describes a framework for service and network
    management automation that takes advantage of YANG modeling technologies. This
    framework is drawn from a network operator perspective irrespective of the origin
    of a data model; thus, it can accommodate YANG modules that are developed outside
    the IETF.</p>"
