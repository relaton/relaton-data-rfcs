abstract:
- content: "<p>The application-specific routing requirements for Urban Low-Power and
    Lossy Networks (U-LLNs) are presented in this document.  In the near future, sensing
    and actuating nodes will be placed outdoors in urban environments so as to improve
    people's living conditions as well as to monitor compliance with increasingly
    strict environmental laws.  These field nodes are expected to measure and report
    a wide gamut of data (for example, the data required by applications that perform
    smart-metering or that monitor meteorological, pollution, and allergy conditions).
    \ The majority of these nodes are expected to communicate wirelessly over a variety
    of links such as IEEE 802.15.4, low-power IEEE 802.11, or IEEE 802.15.1 (Bluetooth),
    which given the limited radio range and the large number of nodes requires the
    use of suitable routing protocols.  The design of such protocols will be mainly
    impacted by the limited resources of the nodes (memory, processing power, battery,
    etc.) and the particularities of the outdoor urban application scenarios.  As
    such, for a wireless solution for Routing Over Low-Power and Lossy (ROLL) networks
    to be useful, the protocol(s) ought to be energy-efficient, scalable, and autonomous.
    \ This documents aims to specify a set of IPv6 routing requirements reflecting
    these and further U-LLNs' tailored characteristics.  This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.</p>"
