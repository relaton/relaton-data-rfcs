abstract:
- content: "<p>The protocol conventions described in this document satisfy some of
    the operational requirements of the Internet Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).
    \ This document specifies the conventions for using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol
    (HTTP/HTTPS) as an interface mechanism to obtain certificates and certificate
    revocation lists (CRLs) from PKI repositories.  Additional mechanisms addressing
    PKIX operational requirements are specified in separate documents. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
