abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes updated methods for handling Unicode strings
    representing usernames and passwords.  The previous approach was known as SASLprep
    (RFC 4013) and was based on Stringprep (RFC 3454).  The methods specified in this
    document provide a more sustainable approach to the handling of internationalized
    usernames and passwords.  This document obsoletes RFC 7613.</p>"
