abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of this RFC is to focus discussion on particular challenges
    in large service networks in general, and the International IP Internet in particular.
    \ No solution discussed in this document is intended as a standard.  Rather, it
    is hoped that a general consensus will emerge as to the appropriate solutions,
    leading eventually to the adoption of standards.  This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.  It does not specify an Internet standard.</p>"
