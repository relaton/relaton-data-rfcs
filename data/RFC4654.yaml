abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies TCP-Friendly Multicast Congestion Control (TFMCC).
    \ TFMCC is a congestion control mechanism for multicast transmissions in a best-effort
    Internet environment.  It is a single-rate congestion control scheme, where the
    sending rate is adapted to the receiver experiencing the worst network conditions.
    \ TFMCC is reasonably fair when competing for bandwidth with TCP flows and has
    a relatively low variation of throughput over time, making it suitable for applications
    where a relatively smooth sending rate is of importance, such as streaming media.
    \ This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</p>"
