abstract:
- content: "<p>This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the ARPA-Internet community,
    and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.  This is a preliminary
    discussion of the Network Block Transfer (NETBLT) protocol.  NETBLT is intended
    for the rapid transfer of a large quantity of data between computers.  It provides
    a transfer that is reliable and flow controlled, and is structured to provide
    maximum throughput over a wide variety of networks.  This description is published
    for discussion and comment, and does not constitute a standard.  As the proposal
    may change, implementation of this document is not advised.  See RFC-998.</p>"
