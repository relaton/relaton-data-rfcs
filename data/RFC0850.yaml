abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo is distributed as an RFC only to make this information easily
    accessible to researchers in the ARPA community.  It does not specify an Internet
    standard.  This RFC defines the standard format for interchange of Network News
    articles among USENET sites.  It describes the format for articles themselves,
    and gives partial standards for transmission of news.  The news transmission is
    not entirely standardized in order to give a good deal of flexibility to the individual
    hosts to choose transmission hardware and software, whether to batch news and
    so on.</p>"
