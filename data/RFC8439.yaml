abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines the ChaCha20 stream cipher as well as the use
    of the Poly1305 authenticator, both as stand-alone algorithms and as a "combined
    mode", or Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) algorithm.</p><p>RFC
    7539, the predecessor of this document, was meant to serve as a stable reference
    and an implementation guide. It was a product of the Crypto Forum Research Group
    (CFRG). This document merges the errata filed against RFC 7539 and adds a little
    text to the Security Considerations section.</p>
