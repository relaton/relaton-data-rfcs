abstract:
- content: "<p>Location-to-Service Translation (LoST) maps service identifiers and
    location information to service contact URIs.  If a LoST client wants to discover
    available services for a particular location, it will perform a  query to the
    LoST server.  However, the LoST server, in its response, does not provide context
    information; that is, it does not provide any additional information about the
    geographical region within which the returned list of services is considered valid.
    \ Therefore, this document defines a Service List Boundary that returns a local
    context along with the list of services returned, in order to assist the client
    in not missing a change in available services when moving.  This document defines
    an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</p>"
