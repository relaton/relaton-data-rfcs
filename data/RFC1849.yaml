abstract:
- content: <p>By the early 1990s, it had become clear that RFC 1036, then the specification
    for the Interchange of USENET Messages, was badly in need of repair. This "Internet-Draft-to-be",
    though never formally published at that time, was widely circulated and became
    the de facto standard for implementors of News Servers and User Agents, rapidly
    acquiring the nickname "Son of 1036". Indeed, under that name, it could fairly
    be described as the best-known Internet Draft (n)ever published, and it formed
    the starting point for the recently adopted Proposed Standards for Netnews.</p><p>It
    is being published now in order to provide the historical background out of which
    those standards have grown. Present-day implementors should be aware that it is
    NOT NOW APPROPRIATE for use in current implementations. This document defines
    a Historic Document for the Internet community.</p>
