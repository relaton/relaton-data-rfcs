abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of this memo is to explain how protocol standards are adopted
    for the ARPA-Internet and the DARPA research community.  There are three important
    aspects to be discussed: the process, the authority, and the complex relationship
    between the DARPA community and the DDN community.  This memo is a policy statement
    on how protocols become official standards for the ARPA-Internet and the DARPA
    research community.  This is an official policy statement of the ICCB and the
    DARPA.</p>"
