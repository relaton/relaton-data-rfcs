abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the format of an electronic signature that can
    remain valid over long periods. This includes evidence as to its validity even
    if the signer or verifying party later attempts to deny (i.e., repudiates) the
    validity of the signature.</p><p>The format can be considered as an extension
    to RFC 3852 and RFC 2634, where, when appropriate, additional signed and unsigned
    attributes have been defined.</p><p>The contents of this Informational RFC amount
    to a transposition of the ETSI Technical Specification (TS) 101 733 V.1.7.4 (CMS
    Advanced Electronic Signatures -- CAdES) and is technically equivalent to it.</p><p>The
    technical contents of this specification are maintained by ETSI. The ETSI TS and
    further updates are available free of charge at: http://www.etsi.org/WebSite/Standards/StandardsDownload.aspx
    This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
