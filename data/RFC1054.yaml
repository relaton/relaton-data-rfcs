abstract:
- content: <p>This memo specifies the extensions required of a host implementation
    of the Internet Protocol (IP) to support multicasting. IP multicasting is the
    transmission of an IP datagram to a "host group", a set hosts identified by a
    single IP destination address. A multicast datagram is delivered to all members
    of its destination host group with the same "best-efforts" reliability as regular
    unicast IP datagrams. It is proposed as a standard for IP multicasting in the
    Internet. This specification is a major revision of RFC-988.</p>
