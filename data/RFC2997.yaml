abstract:
- content: "<p>The Null Service allows applications to identify themselves to network
    Quality of Service (QoS) policy agents, using RSVP signaling.  However, it does
    not require them to specify resource requirements.  QoS policy agents in the network
    respond by applying QoS policies appropriate for the application (as determined
    by the network administrator).  This mode of RSVP usage is particularly applicable
    to networks that combine differentiated service (diffserv) QoS mechanisms with
    RSVP signaling.  In this environment, QoS policy agents may direct the signaled
    application's traffic to a particular diffserv class of service. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
