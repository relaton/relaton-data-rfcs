    (PoC) service where SIP is the protocol used to establish half-duplex media sessions
    across different participants, to send instant messages, etc.  This document defines
    a SIP event package to support publication, subscription, and notification of
    additional capabilities required by the PoC service.  This SIP event package is
    applicable to the PoC service and may not be applicable to the general Internet.
