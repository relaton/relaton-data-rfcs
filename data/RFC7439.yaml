abstract:
- content: "<p>This document reviews the Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) protocol
    suite in the context of IPv6 and identifies gaps that must be addressed in order
    to allow MPLS-related protocols and applications to be used with IPv6-only networks.
    This document is intended to focus on gaps in the standards defining the MPLS
    suite, and is not intended to highlight particular vendor implementations (or
    lack thereof) in the context of IPv6-only MPLS functionality.</p><p>In the data
    plane, MPLS fully supports IPv6, and MPLS labeled packets can be carried over
    IPv6 packets in a variety of encapsulations. However, support for IPv6 among MPLS
    control-plane protocols, MPLS applications, MPLS Operations, Administration, and
    Maintenance (OAM), and MIB modules is mixed, with some protocols having major
    gaps. For most major gaps, work is in progress to upgrade the relevant protocols.</p>"
