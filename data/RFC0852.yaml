abstract:
- content: "<p>This RFC specifies the ARPANET Short Blocking Feature, which will allow
    ARPANET hosts to optionally shorten the IMP's host blocking timer.  This Feature
    is a replacement of the ARPANET non-blocking host interface, which was never implemented,
    and will be available to hosts using either the 1822 or 1822L Host Access Protocol.
    \ This RFC is also being presented as a solicitation of comments on the Short
    Blocking Feature, especially from host network software implementers and maintainers.</p>"
