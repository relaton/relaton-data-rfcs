abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the use of a scope control Border Gateway Protocol
    (BGP) community.  This well-known advisory transitive community allows an origin
    AS to specify the extent to which a specific route should be externally propagated.
    \ In particular this community, NOPEER, allows an origin AS to specify that a
    route with this attribute need not be advertised across bilateral peer connections.
    \ This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
