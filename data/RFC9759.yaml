abstract:
- content: "<p>Estimating time requirements for tasks, both critical and mundane,
    remains a challenge in engineering, business, and everyday communication. Existing
    models fail due to inherent unpredictability and inconsistencies in human estimation.
    This document introduces the Two-Week Principle (TWP), a novel, universally adaptable
    time scale that seeks to standardize all temporal references to a singular, uniform
    duration. TWP ensures clarity, predictability, and synchronization across all
    sectors that rely on time-based scheduling.</p>"
