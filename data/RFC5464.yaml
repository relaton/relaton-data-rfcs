abstract:
- content: <p>The METADATA extension to the Internet Message Access Protocol permits
    clients and servers to maintain "annotations" or "metadata" on IMAP servers.  It
    is possible to have annotations on a per-mailbox basis or on the server as a whole.  For
    example, this would allow comments about the purpose of a particular mailbox to
    be "attached" to that mailbox, or a "message of the day" containing server status
    information to be made available to anyone logging in to the server. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
