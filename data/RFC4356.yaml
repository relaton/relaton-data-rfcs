abstract:
- content: <p>The cellular telephone industry has defined a service known as the Multimedia
    Messaging Service (MMS). This service uses formats and protocols that are similar
    to, but differ in key ways from, those used in Internet mail.</p><p>One important
    difference between MMS and Internet Mail is that MMS uses headers that start with
    "X-Mms-" to carry a variety of user agent- and server-related information elements.</p><p>This
    document specifies how to exchange messages between these two services, including
    mapping information elements as used in MMS X-Mms-* headers as well as delivery
    and disposition reports, to and from that used in SMTP and Internet message headers.
