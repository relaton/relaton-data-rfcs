abstract:
- content: "<p>The OSI Directory uses distinguished names as the primary keys to entries
    in the directory.  Distinguished Names are encoded in ASN.1.  When a distinguished
    name is communicated between to users not using a directory protocol (e.g., in
    a mail message), there is a need to have a user-oriented string representation
    of distinguished name.  This specification defines a string format for representing
    names, which is designed to give a clean representation of commonly used names,
    whilst being able to represent any distinguished name. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
