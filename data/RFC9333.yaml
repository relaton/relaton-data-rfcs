abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the minimal properties that an IP Encapsulating
    Security Payload (ESP) implementation needs to meet to remain interoperable with
    the standard ESP as defined in RFC 4303. Such a minimal version of ESP is not
    intended to become a replacement of ESP in RFC 4303. Instead, a minimal implementation
    is expected to be optimized for constrained environments while remaining interoperable
    with implementations of ESP. In addition, this document provides some considerations
    for implementing minimal ESP in a constrained environment, such as limiting the
    number of flash writes, handling frequent wakeup and sleep states, limiting wakeup
    time, and reducing the use of random generation.</p><p>This document does not
    update or modify RFC 4303. It provides a compact description of how to implement
    the minimal version of that protocol. RFC 4303 remains the authoritative description.</p>"
