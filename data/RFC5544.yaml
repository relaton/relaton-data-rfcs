abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes an envelope that can be used to bind a file
    (not necessarily protected by means of cryptographic techniques) with one or more
    time-stamp tokens obtained for that file, where "time-stamp token" has the meaning
    defined in RFC 3161 or its successors. Additional types of temporal evidence are
    also allowed.</p><p>The proposed envelope is based on the Cryptographic Message
    Syntax as defined in RFC 5652. This document is not an Internet Standards Track
    specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>
