abstract:
- content: "<p>The MediaCtrl working group in the IETF has proposed an architecture
    for controlling media services.  The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is used
    as the signaling protocol that provides many inherent capabilities for message
    routing.  In addition to such signaling properties, a need exists for intelligent,
    application-level media service selection based on non-static signaling properties.
    \ This is especially true when considered in conjunction with deployment architectures
    that include 1:M and M:N combinations of Application Servers and Media Servers.
    \ This document introduces a Media Resource Broker (MRB) entity, which manages
    the availability of Media Servers and the media resource demands of Application
    Servers.  The document includes potential deployment options for an MRB and appropriate
    interfaces to Application Servers and Media Servers.</p>"
