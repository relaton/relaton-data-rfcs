abstract:
- content: <p>Open Caching architecture is a use case of Content Delivery Network
    Interconnection (CDNI) in which the commercial Content Delivery Network (CDN)
    is the upstream CDN (uCDN) and the ISP caching layer serves as the downstream
    CDN (dCDN). RFC 8006 defines footprint types that are used for footprint objects
    as part of the Metadata interface (MI). The footprint types are also used for
    the Footprint & Capabilities Advertisement interface (FCI) as defined in RFC 8008.
    This document defines two new footprint types. The first footprint type defined
    is an ISO 3166-2 country subdivision code. Defining this country subdivision code
    improves granularity for delegation as compared to the ISO 3166-1 country code
    footprint type defined in RFC 8006. The ISO 3166-2 country subdivision code is
    also added as a new entity domain type in the "ALTO Entity Domain Types" registry
    defined in Section 7.4 of RFC 9241. The second footprint type defines a footprint
    union to aggregate footprint objects. This allows for additive semantics over
    the narrowing semantics defined in Appendix B of RFC 8008 and therefore updates
    RFC 8008. The two new footprint types are based on the requirements raised by
    Open Caching but are also applicable to CDNI use cases in general.</p>
