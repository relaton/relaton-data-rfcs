abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes domain-name-based service principal names and
    the corresponding name type for the Generic Security Service Application Programming
    Interface (GSS-API). Internationalization of the GSS-API is also covered.</p><p>Domain-based
    service names are similar to host-based service names, but using a domain name
    (not necessarily an Internet domain name) in addition to a hostname. The primary
    purpose of domain-based names is to provide a measure of protection to applications
    that utilize insecure service discovery protocols. This is achieved by providing
    a way to name clustered services after the "domain" which they service, thereby
    allowing their clients to authorize the service's servers based on authentication
    of their service names. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
