abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes the use of BGP as a control plane for networks
    that support service function chaining. The document introduces a new BGP address
    family called the "Service Function Chain (SFC) Address Family Identifier / Subsequent
    Address Family Identifier" (SFC AFI/SAFI) with two Route Types. One Route Type
    is originated by a node to advertise that it hosts a particular instance of a
    specified service function. This Route Type also provides "instructions" on how
    to send a packet to the hosting node in a way that indicates that the service
    function has to be applied to the packet. The other Route Type is used by a controller
    to advertise the paths of "chains" of service functions and give a unique designator
    to each such path so that they can be used in conjunction with the Network Service
    Header (NSH) defined in RFC 8300.</p><p>This document adopts the service function
    chaining architecture described in RFC 7665.</p>
