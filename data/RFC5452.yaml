abstract:
- content: "<p>The current Internet climate poses serious threats to the Domain Name
    System. In the interim period before the DNS protocol can be secured more fully,
    measures can already be taken to harden the DNS to make 'spoofing' a recursing
    nameserver many orders of magnitude harder.</p><p>Even a cryptographically secured
    DNS benefits from having the ability to discard bogus responses quickly, as this
    potentially saves large amounts of computation.</p><p>By describing certain behavior
    that has previously not been standardized, this document sets out how to make
    the DNS more resilient against accepting incorrect responses. This document updates
    RFC 2181. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
