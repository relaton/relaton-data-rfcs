abstract:
- content: <p>This document introduces a BGP capability called the "Long-Lived Graceful
    Restart Capability" (or "LLGR Capability"). The benefit of this capability is
    that stale routes can be retained for a longer time upon session failure than
    is provided for by BGP Graceful Restart (as described in RFC 4724). A well-known
    BGP community called "LLGR_STALE" is introduced for marking stale routes retained
    for a longer time. A second well-known BGP community called "NO_LLGR" is introduced
    for marking routes for which these procedures should not be applied. We also specify
    that such long-lived stale routes be treated as the least preferred and that their
    advertisements be limited to BGP speakers that have advertised the capability.
    Use of this extension is not advisable in all cases, and we provide guidelines
    to help determine if it is.</p><p>This memo updates RFC 6368 by specifying that
    the LLGR_STALE community must be propagated into, or out of, the path attributes
    exchanged between the Provider Edge (PE) and Customer Edge (CE) routers.</p>
