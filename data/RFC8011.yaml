abstract:
- content: '<p>The Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) is an application-level protocol
    for distributed printing using Internet tools and technologies. This document
    describes a simplified model consisting of abstract objects, attributes, and operations
    that is independent of encoding and transport. The model consists of several objects,
    including Printers and Jobs. Jobs optionally support multiple Documents.</p><p>IPP
    semantics allow End Users and Operators to query Printer capabilities; submit
    Print Jobs; inquire about the status of Print Jobs and Printers; and cancel, hold,
    and release Print Jobs. IPP semantics also allow Operators to pause and resume
    Jobs and Printers.</p><p>Security, internationalization, and directory issues
    are also addressed by the model and semantics. The IPP message encoding and transport
    are described in "Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Encoding and Transport" (RFC
    8010).</p><p>This document obsoletes RFCs 2911, 3381, and 3382.</p>'
