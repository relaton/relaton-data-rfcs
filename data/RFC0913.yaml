abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes a proposed Simple File Transfer Protocol (SFTP).
    \ It fills the need of people wanting a protocol that is more useful than TFTP
    but easier to implement (and less powerful) than FTP.  SFTP supports user access
    control, file transfers, directory listing, directory changing, file renaming
    and deleting.  Discussion of this proposal is encouraged, and suggestions for
    improvements may be sent to the author.</p>"
