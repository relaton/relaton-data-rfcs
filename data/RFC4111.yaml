abstract:
- content: "<p>This document addresses security aspects pertaining to Provider-Provisioned
    Virtual Private Networks (PPVPNs).  First, it describes the security threats in
    the context of PPVPNs and defensive techniques to combat those threats.  It considers
    security issues deriving both from malicious behavior of anyone and from negligent
    or incorrect behavior of the providers.  It also describes how these security
    attacks should be detected and reported.  It then discusses possible user requirements
    for security of a PPVPN service.  These user requirements translate into corresponding
    provider requirements.  In addition, the provider may have additional requirements
    to make its network infrastructure secure to a level that can meet the PPVPN customer's
    expectations.  Finally, this document defines a template that may be used to describe
    and analyze the security characteristics of a specific PPVPN technology.  This
    memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
