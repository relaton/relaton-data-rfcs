abstract:
- content: "<p>This RFC suggests a change in the method of specifying the IP address
    to add new classes of networks to be called F, G, H, and K, to reduce the amount
    of wasted address space, and to increase the available IP address number space,
    especially for smaller organizations or classes of connectors that do not need
    or do not want a full Class C IP address. This memo provides information for the
    Internet community. It does not specify an Internet standard.</p>"
