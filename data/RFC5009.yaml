    header field (P-header) to be used by the European Telecommunications Standards
    Institute (ETSI) Telecommunications and Internet-converged Services and Protocols
    for Advanced Networks (TISPAN) for the purpose of authorizing early media flows
    in Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) IP Multimedia Subsystems (IMS).
    \ This header field is useful in any SIP network that is interconnected with other
    SIP networks and needs to control the flow of media in the early dialog state.
    \ This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
