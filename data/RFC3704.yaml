abstract:
- content: "<p>BCP 38, RFC 2827, is designed to limit the impact of distributed denial
    of service attacks, by denying traffic with spoofed addresses access to the network,
    and to help ensure that traffic is traceable to its correct source network.  As
    a side effect of protecting the Internet against such attacks, the network implementing
    the solution also protects itself from this and other attacks, such as spoofed
    management access to networking equipment.  There are cases when this may create
    problems, e.g., with multihoming.  This document describes the current ingress
    filtering operational mechanisms, examines generic issues related to ingress filtering,
    and delves into the effects on multihoming in particular.  This memo updates RFC
    2827.  This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet
    Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.</p>"
