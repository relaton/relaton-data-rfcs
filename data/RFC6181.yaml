abstract:
- content: "<p>Multipath TCP (MPTCP for short) describes the extensions proposed for
    TCP so that endpoints of a given TCP connection can use multiple paths to exchange
    data.  Such extensions enable the exchange of segments using different source-destination
    address pairs, resulting in the capability of using multiple paths in a significant
    number of scenarios.  Some level of multihoming and mobility support can be achieved
    through these extensions.  However, the support for multiple IP addresses per
    endpoint may have implications on the security of the resulting MPTCP.  This note
    includes a threat analysis for MPTCP.  This document is not an Internet Standards
    Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
