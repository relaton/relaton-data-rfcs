abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies version 3 of the RFC Editor Model. The model
    defines two high-level tasks related to the RFC Series. First, policy definition
    is the joint responsibility of the RFC Series Working Group (RSWG), which produces
    policy proposals, and the RFC Series Approval Board (RSAB), which approves such
    proposals. Second, policy implementation is primarily the responsibility of the
    RFC Production Center (RPC) as contractually overseen by the IETF Administration
    Limited Liability Company (IETF LLC). In addition, various responsibilities of
    the RFC Editor function are now performed alone or in combination by the RSWG,
    RSAB, RPC, RFC Series Consulting Editor (RSCE), and IETF LLC. Finally, this document
    establishes the Editorial Stream for publication of future policy definition documents
    produced through the processes defined herein.</p><p>This document obsoletes RFC
    8728. This document updates RFCs 7841, 8729, and 8730.</p>"
