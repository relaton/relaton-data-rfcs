abstract:
- content: "<p>Packet delay variation metrics appear in many different standards documents.
    The metric definition in RFC 3393 has considerable flexibility, and it allows
    multiple formulations of delay variation through the specification of different
    packet selection functions.</p><p>Although flexibility provides wide coverage
    and room for new ideas, it can make comparisons of independent implementations
    more difficult. Two different formulations of delay variation have come into wide
    use in the context of active measurements. This memo examines a range of circumstances
    for active measurements of delay variation and their uses, and recommends which
    of the two forms is best matched to particular conditions and tasks. This memo
    provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
