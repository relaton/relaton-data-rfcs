abstract:
- content: "<p>Although the SIP History-Info header field described in RFC 7044 is
    the solution adopted in IETF, the non-standard Diversion header field described,
    as Historic, in RFC 5806 is nevertheless already implemented and used for conveying
    call-diversion-related information in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) signaling.</p><p>RFC
    7044 obsoletes the original RFC 4244 and redefines the History-Info header field
    for capturing the history information in requests.</p><p>Since the Diversion header
    field is used in existing network implementations for the transport of call diversion
    information, its interworking with the SIP History-Info standardized solution
    is needed. This document describes a recommended interworking guideline between
    the Diversion header field and the History-Info header field to handle call diversion
    information. This work is intended to enable the migration from non-standard implementations
    toward IETF specification-based implementations.</p><p>This document obsoletes
    RFC 6044, which describes the interworking between the Diversion header field
    defined in RFC 5806 and the obsoleted History-Info header field defined on RFC
    4244.</p>"
