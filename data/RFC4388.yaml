- content: "<p>A Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol version 4 (DHCPv4) server is
    the authoritative source of IP addresses that it has provided to DHCPv4 clients.
    \ Other processes and devices that already make use of DHCPv4 may need to access
    this information.  The leasequery protocol provides these processes and devices
    a lightweight way to access IP address information. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
