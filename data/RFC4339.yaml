abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes three approaches for IPv6 recursive DNS server
    address configuration.  It details the operational attributes of three solutions:
    RA option, DHCPv6 option, and well-known anycast addresses for recursive DNS servers.
    \ Additionally, it suggests the deployment scenarios in four kinds of networks
    (ISP, enterprise, 3GPP, and unmanaged networks) considering multi-solution resolution.
    \ This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
