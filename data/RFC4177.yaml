abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo provides an analysis of the architectural aspects of multi-homing
    support for the IPv6 protocol suite.  The purpose of this analysis is to provide
    a taxonomy for classification of various proposed approaches to multi-homing.
    \ It is also an objective of this exercise to identify common aspects of this
    domain of study, and also to provide a framework that can allow exploration of
    some of the further implications of various architectural extensions that are
    intended to support multi-homing.  This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.</p>"
