abstract:
- content: "<p>Routing protocols are subject to attacks that can harm individual users
    or network operations as a whole.  This document provides a description and a
    summary of generic threats that affect routing protocols in general.  This work
    describes threats, including threat sources and capabilities, threat actions,
    and threat consequences, as well as a breakdown of routing functions that might
    be attacked separately.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
