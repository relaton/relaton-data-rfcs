abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet community needs to be asking what the most important policy
    issues facing the network are. And given agreement on any particular set of policy
    issues, the next thing we should be asking is, what would be some of the political
    choices that would follow for Congress to make? This memo is a shortened version
    of the suggested policy draft. This memo provides information for the Internet
    community. It does not specify an Internet standard.</p>"
