abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines extensions to the current sockets API for the
    Host Identity Protocol (HIP).  The extensions focus on the use of public-key-based
    identifiers discovered via DNS resolution, but also define interfaces for manual
    bindings between Host Identity Tags (HITs) and locators.  With the extensions,
    the application can also support more relaxed security models where communication
    can be non-HIP-based, according to local policies.  The extensions in this document
    are experimental and provide basic tools for further experimentation with policies.
    \ This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</p>"
