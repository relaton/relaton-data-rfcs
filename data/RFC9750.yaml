abstract:
- content: "<p>The Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol (RFC 9420) provides a group
    key agreement protocol for messaging applications. MLS is designed to protect
    against eavesdropping, tampering, and message forgery, and to provide forward
    secrecy (FS) and post-compromise security (PCS).</p><p>This document describes
    the architecture for using MLS in a general secure group messaging infrastructure
    and defines the security goals for MLS. It provides guidance on building a group
    messaging system and discusses security and privacy trade-offs offered by multiple
    security mechanisms that are part of the MLS protocol (e.g., frequency of public
    encryption key rotation). The document also provides guidance for parts of the
    infrastructure that are not standardized by MLS and are instead left to the application.</p><p>While
    the recommendations of this document are not mandatory to follow in order to interoperate
    at the protocol level, they affect the overall security guarantees that are achieved
    by a messaging application. This is especially true in the case of active adversaries
    that are able to compromise clients, the Delivery Service (DS), or the Authentication
    Service (AS).</p>"
