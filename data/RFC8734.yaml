abstract:
- content: "<p>Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) Brainpool curves were an option for
    authentication and key exchange in the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol
    version 1.2 but were deprecated by the IETF for use with TLS version 1.3 because
    they had little usage. However, these curves have not been shown to have significant
    cryptographical weaknesses, and there is some interest in using several of these
    curves in TLS 1.3.</p><p>This document provides the necessary protocol mechanisms
    for using ECC Brainpool curves in TLS 1.3. This approach is not endorsed by the
    IETF.</p>"
