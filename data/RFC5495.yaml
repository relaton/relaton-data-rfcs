abstract:
- content: "<p>The Hello message for the Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) has
    been defined to establish and maintain basic signaling node adjacencies for Label
    Switching Routers (LSRs) participating in a Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)
    traffic-engineered (TE) network. The Hello message has been extended for use in
    Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks for state recovery of control channel or nodal
    faults.</p><p>The GMPLS protocol definitions for RSVP also allow a restarting
    node to learn which label it previously allocated for use on a Label Switched
    Path (LSP).</p><p>Further RSVP protocol extensions have been defined to enable
    a restarting node to recover full control plane state by exchanging RSVP messages
    with its upstream and downstream neighbors.</p><p>This document provides an informational
    clarification of the control plane procedures for a GMPLS network when there are
    multiple node failures, and describes how full control plane state can be recovered
    in different scenarios where the order in which the nodes restart is different.</p><p>This
    document does not define any new processes or procedures. All protocol mechanisms
    are already defined in the referenced documents. This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.</p>"
