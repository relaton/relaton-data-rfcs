abstract:
- content: <p>This document provides an applicability statement (RFC 2026, Section
    3.2) that describes how to exchange structured business data securely using the
    HTTP transfer protocol, instead of SMTP; the applicability statement for SMTP
    is found in RFC 3335. Structured business data may be XML; Electronic Data Interchange
    (EDI) in either the American National Standards Committee (ANSI) X12 format or
    the UN Electronic Data Interchange for Administration, Commerce, and Transport
    (UN/EDIFACT) format; or other structured data formats. The data is packaged using
    standard MIME structures. Authentication and data confidentiality are obtained
    by using Cryptographic Message Syntax with S/MIME security body parts. Authenticated
    acknowledgements make use of multipart/signed Message Disposition Notification
    (MDN) responses to the original HTTP message. This applicability statement is
    informally referred to as "AS2" because it is the second applicability statement,
    produced after "AS1", RFC 3335. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
