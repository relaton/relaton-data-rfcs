abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses a number of differences between the Intermediate
    System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) protocol as described in ISO 10589 and the
    protocol as it is deployed today. These differences are discussed as a service
    to those implementing, testing, and deploying the IS-IS Protocol. A companion
    document discusses differences between the protocol described in RFC 1195 and
    the protocol as it is deployed today for routing IP traffic. This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.</p>"
