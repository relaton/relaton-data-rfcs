abstract:
- content: "<p>Low-Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) are a class of network in which
    both the routers and their interconnect are constrained.  LLN routers typically
    operate with constraints on processing power, memory, and energy (battery power).
    \ Their interconnects are characterized by high loss rates, low data rates, and
    instability.  LLNs are comprised of anything from a few dozen to thousands of
    routers.  Supported traffic flows include point-to-point (between devices inside
    the LLN), point-to-multipoint (from a central control point to a subset of devices
    inside the LLN), and multipoint-to-point (from devices inside the LLN towards
    a central control point).  This document specifies the IPv6 Routing Protocol for
    Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL), which provides a mechanism whereby multipoint-to-point
    traffic from devices inside the LLN towards a central control point as well as
    point-to-multipoint traffic from the central control point to the devices inside
    the LLN are supported.  Support for point-to-point traffic is also available.
