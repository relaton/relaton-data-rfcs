abstract:
- content: "<p>When a private network or internetwork grows very large, it is sometimes
    not possible to address all interfaces using private IPv4 address space because
    there are not enough addresses. This document describes the problems faced by
    those networks, the available options, and the issues involved in assigning a
    new block of private IPv4 address space.</p><p>While this informational document
    does not make a recommendation for action, it documents the issues surrounding
    the various options that have been considered. This document is not an Internet
    Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
