abstract:
- content: "<p>Parallel NFS (pNFS) allows a separation between the metadata (onto
    a metadata server) and data (onto a storage device) for a file.  The flexible
    file layout type is defined in this document as an extension to pNFS that allows
    the use of storage devices that require only a limited degree of interaction with
    the metadata server and use already-existing protocols.  Client-side mirroring
    is also added to provide replication of files.</p>"
