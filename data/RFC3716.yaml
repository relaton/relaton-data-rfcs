abstract:
- content: "<p>In the fall of 2003, the IETF Chair and the IAB Chair formed an IAB
    Advisory Committee (AdvComm), with a mandate to review the existing IETF administrative
    structure and relationships (RFC Editor, IETF Secretariat, IANA) and to propose
    changes to the IETF management process or structure to improve the overall functioning
    of the IETF.  The AdvComm mandate did not include the standards process itself.
    \ This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
