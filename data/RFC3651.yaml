abstract:
- content: "<p>The Handle System is a general-purpose global name service that allows
    secured name resolution and administration over the public Internet.  This document
    provides a detailed description of the Handle System namespace, and its data,
    service, and operation models.  The namespace definition specifies the handle
    syntax and its semantic structure.  The data model defines the data structures
    used by the Handle System protocol and any pre-defined data types for carrying
    out the handle service.  The service model provides definitions of various Handle
    System components and explains how they work together over the network.  Finally,
    the Handle System operation model describes its service operation in terms of
    messages transmitted between client and server, and the client authentication
    process based on the Handle System authentication protocol.</p>"
