abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an extension block for use with the Delay- Tolerant
    Networking (DTN) Bundle Protocol. This Previous-Hop Insertion Block (PHIB) extension
    block is designed to be inserted by a forwarding node to provide the endpoint
    identifier (EID) of an endpoint of which the forwarding node is a member so that
    this EID may be conveyed to the next-hop receiving node. Knowledge of an EID of
    an endpoint of which a previous-hop node is a member may be required in some circumstances
    to support certain routing protocols (e.g., flood routing). If this EID cannot
    be provided by the convergence layer or other means, the PHIB defines the mechanism
    whereby the EID can be provided with the bundle. Each PHIB is always removed from
    the bundle by the receiving node so that its presence within the bundle is limited
    to exactly one hop. This document defines the format and processing of this PHIB.
    This document is a product of the Delay-Tolerant Networking Research Group and
    has been reviewed by that group. No objections to its publication as an RFC were
    raised. This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</p>"
