abstract:
- content: "<p>The authorization request in OAuth 2.0 described in RFC 6749 utilizes
    query parameter serialization, which means that authorization request parameters
    are encoded in the URI of the request and sent through user agents such as web
    browsers. While it is easy to implement, it means that a) the communication through
    the user agents is not integrity protected and thus, the parameters can be tainted,
    b) the source of the communication is not authenticated, and c) the communication
    through the user agents can be monitored. Because of these weaknesses, several
    attacks to the protocol have now been put forward.</p><p>This document introduces
    the ability to send request parameters in a JSON Web Token (JWT) instead, which
    allows the request to be signed with JSON Web Signature (JWS) and encrypted with
    JSON Web Encryption (JWE) so that the integrity, source authentication, and confidentiality
    properties of the authorization request are attained. The request can be sent
    by value or by reference.</p>"
