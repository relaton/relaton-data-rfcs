abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet and its architecture have grown in evolutionary fashion
    from modest beginnings, rather than from a Grand Plan.  While this process of
    evolution is one of the main reasons for the technology's success, it nevertheless
    seems useful to record a snapshot of the current principles of the Internet architecture.
    \ This is intended for general guidance and general interest, and is in no way
    intended to be a formal or invariant reference model.  This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.  This memo does not specify an Internet standard of
    any kind.</p>"
