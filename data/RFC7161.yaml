abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an experimental multicast handover optimization
    mechanism for Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) to accelerate the delivery of multicast
    traffic to mobile nodes after handovers.  The mechanism, called Subscription Information
    Acquisition through the LMA (SIAL), is based on speeding up the acquisition of
    mobile nodes' multicast context by the mobile access gateways.  To do that, extensions
    to the current PMIPv6 protocol are proposed.  These extensions are not only applicable
    to the base solution for multicast support in Proxy Mobile IPv6, but they can
    also be applied to other solutions developed to avoid the tunnel convergence problem.
    \ Furthermore, these extensions are also independent of the role played by the
    mobile access gateway within the multicast network (acting as either multicast
    listener discovery proxy or multicast router).</p>"
