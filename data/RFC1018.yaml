abstract:
- content: <p>This memo is a discussion of some of the ideas expressed in RFC-1016
    on Source Quench. This memo introduces the distinction of the cause of congestion
    in a gateway between the effects of "Funneling" and "Mismatch". It is offered
    in the same spirit as RFC-1016; to stimulate discussion. The opinions offered
    are personal, not corporate, opinions. Distribution of this memo is unlimited.</p>
