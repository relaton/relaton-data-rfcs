abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a mechanism by which information servers can
    exchange indices of information from their databases by making use of the Common
    Indexing Protocol (CIP).  This document defines the structure of the index information
    being exchanged, as well as the appropriate meanings for the headers that are
    defined in the Common Indexing Protocol.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol
    for the Internet community.</p>"
