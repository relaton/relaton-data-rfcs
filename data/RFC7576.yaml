abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a problem statement and general gap analysis
    for an IP-based Autonomic Network that is mainly based on distributed network
    devices. The document provides background by reviewing the current status of autonomic
    aspects of IP networks and the extent to which current network management depends
    on centralization and human administrators. Finally, the document outlines the
    general features that are missing from current network abilities and are needed
    in the ideal Autonomic Network concept.</p><p>This document is a product of the
    IRTF's Network Management Research Group.</p>"
