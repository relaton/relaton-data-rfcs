abstract:
- content: "<p>The QUIC transport protocol has several features that are desirable
    in a transport for HTTP, such as stream multiplexing, per-stream flow control,
    and low-latency connection establishment.  This document describes a mapping of
    HTTP semantics over QUIC.  This document also identifies HTTP/2 features that
    are subsumed by QUIC and describes how HTTP/2 extensions can be ported to HTTP/3.</p>"
