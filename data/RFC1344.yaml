abstract:
- content: "<p>While MIME was carefully designed so that it does not require any changes
    to Internet electronic message transport facilities, there are several ways in
    which message transport systems may want to take advantage of MIME.  These opportunities
    are the subject of this memo.  This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.  It does not specify an Internet standard.</p>"
