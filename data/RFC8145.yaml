abstract:
- content: "<p>The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) were developed to provide origin
    authentication and integrity protection for DNS data by using digital signatures.
    \ These digital signatures can be verified by building a chain of trust starting
    from a trust anchor and proceeding down to a particular node in the DNS.  This
    document specifies two different ways for validating resolvers to signal to a
    server which keys are referenced in their chain of trust.  The data from such
    signaling allow zone administrators to monitor the progress of rollovers in a
    DNSSEC-signed zone.</p>"
