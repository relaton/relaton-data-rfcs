abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes a threat model for the context in which External
    Border Gateway Protocol (EBGP) path security mechanisms will be developed. The
    threat model includes an analysis of the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI)
    and focuses on the ability of an Autonomous System (AS) to verify the authenticity
    of the AS path info received in a BGP update. We use the term "PATHSEC" to refer
    to any BGP path security technology that makes use of the RPKI. PATHSEC will secure
    BGP, consistent with the inter-AS security focus of the RPKI.</p><p>The document
    characterizes classes of potential adversaries that are considered to be threats
    and examines classes of attacks that might be launched against PATHSEC. It does
    not revisit attacks against unprotected BGP, as that topic has already been addressed
    in the BGP-4 standard. It concludes with a brief discussion of residual vulnerabilities.</p>
