abstract:
- content: "<p>The Benchmarking Methodology Working Group (BMWG) has been developing
    key performance metrics and laboratory test methods since 1990, and continues
    this work at present.  The methods described in RFC 2544 are intended to generate
    traffic that overloads network device resources in order to assess their capacity.
    \ Overload of shared resources would likely be harmful to user traffic performance
    on a production network, and there are further negative consequences identified
    with production application of the methods.  This memo clarifies the scope of
    RFC 2544 and other IETF BMWG benchmarking work for isolated test environments
    only, and it encourages new standards activity for measurement methods applicable
    outside that scope.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;
    it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
