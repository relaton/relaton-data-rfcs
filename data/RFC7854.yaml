abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP), which can
    be used to monitor BGP sessions.  BMP is intended to provide a convenient interface
    for obtaining route views.  Prior to the introduction of BMP, screen scraping
    was the most commonly used approach to obtaining such views.  The design goals
    are to keep BMP simple, useful, easily implemented, and minimally service affecting.
    \ BMP is not suitable for use as a routing protocol.</p>"
