abstract:
- content: "<p>Neighbor Discovery (RFC 4861) is used by IPv6 nodes to determine the
    link-layer addresses of neighboring nodes as well as to discover and maintain
    reachability information.  This document updates RFC 4861 to allow routers to
    proactively create a Neighbor Cache entry when a new IPv6 address is assigned
    to a node.  It also updates RFC 4861 and recommends that nodes send unsolicited
    Neighbor Advertisements upon assigning a new IPv6 address.  These changes will
    minimize the delay and packet loss when a node initiates connections to an off-link
    destination from a new IPv6 address.</p>"
