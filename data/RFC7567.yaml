abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo presents recommendations to the Internet community concerning
    measures to improve and preserve Internet performance. It presents a strong recommendation
    for testing, standardization, and widespread deployment of active queue management
    (AQM) in network devices to improve the performance of today's Internet. It also
    urges a concerted effort of research, measurement, and ultimate deployment of
    AQM mechanisms to protect the Internet from flows that are not sufficiently responsive
    to congestion notification.</p><p>Based on 15 years of experience and new research,
    this document replaces the recommendations of RFC 2309.</p>"
