abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides an overview of possible avenues for denial-of-service
    (DoS) attack on Internet systems.  The aim is to encourage protocol designers
    and network engineers towards designs that are more robust.  We discuss partial
    solutions that reduce the effectiveness of attacks, and how some solutions might
    inadvertently open up alternative vulnerabilities.  This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.</p>"
