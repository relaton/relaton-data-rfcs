abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines a network management architecture that uses the International
    Organization for Standardization's (ISO) Common Management Information Services/Common
    Management Information Protocol (CMIS/CMIP) in a TCP/IP environment.  This architecture
    provides a means by which control and monitoring information can be exchanged
    between a manager and a remote network element.  In particular, this memo defines
    the means for implementing the Draft International Standard (DIS) version of CMIS/CMIP
    on top of Internet transport protocols for the purpose of carrying management
    information defined in the Internet-standard management information base.  DIS
    CMIS/CMIP is suitable for deployment in TCP/IP networks while CMIS/CMIP moves
    toward becoming an International Standard.  Together with the relevant ISO standards
    and the companion RFCs that describe the initial structure of management information
    and management information base, these documents provide the basis for a comprehensive
    architecture and system for managing TCP/IP- based internets, and in particular
    the Internet.</p>"
