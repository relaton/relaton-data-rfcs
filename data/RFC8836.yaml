abstract:
- content: "<p>Congestion control is needed for all data transported across the Internet,
    in order to promote fair usage and prevent congestion collapse. The requirements
    for interactive, point-to-point real-time multimedia, which needs low-delay, semi-reliable
    data delivery, are different from the requirements for bulk transfer like FTP
    or bursty transfers like web pages. Due to an increasing amount of RTP-based real-time
    media traffic on the Internet (e.g., with the introduction of the Web Real-Time
    Communication (WebRTC)), it is especially important to ensure that this kind of
    traffic is congestion controlled.</p><p>This document describes a set of requirements
    that can be used to evaluate other congestion control mechanisms in order to figure
    out their fitness for this purpose, and in particular to provide a set of possible
    requirements for a real-time media congestion avoidance technique.</p>"
