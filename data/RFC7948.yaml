abstract:
- content: "<p>The popularity of Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) brings new challenges
    to interconnecting networks. While bilateral External BGP (EBGP) sessions between
    exchange participants were historically the most common means of exchanging reachability
    information over an IXP, the overhead associated with this interconnection method
    causes serious operational and administrative scaling problems for IXP participants.</p><p>Multilateral
    interconnection using Internet route servers can dramatically reduce the administrative
    and operational overhead associated with connecting to IXPs; in some cases, route
    servers are used by IXP participants as their preferred means of exchanging routing
    information.</p><p>This document describes operational considerations for multilateral
    interconnections at IXPs.</p>"
