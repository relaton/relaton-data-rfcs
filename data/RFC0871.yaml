abstract:
- content: "<p>This RFC is primarily intended as a perspective on the ARM and points
    out some of the differences between the ARM and the ISORM which were expressed
    by members in NWG general meetings, NWG protocol design committee meetings, the
    ARPA Internet Working Group, and private conversations over the intervening years.
    \ Originally published as M82-47 by the MITRE Corporation, Bedford, Massachusetts.</p>"
