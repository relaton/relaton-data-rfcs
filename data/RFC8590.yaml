abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) extension
    for notifying clients of operations on client-sponsored objects that were not
    initiated by the client through EPP.  These operations may include contractual
    or policy requirements including, but not limited to, regular batch processes,
    customer support actions, Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy (UDRP)
    or Uniform Rapid Suspension (URS) actions, court-directed actions, and bulk updates
    based on customer requests.  Since the client is not directly involved or knowledgable
    of these operations, the extension is used along with an EPP object mapping to
    provide the resulting state of the postoperation object, and optionally a preoperation
    object, with the operation metadata of what, when, who, and why.</p>"
