abstract:
- content: "<p>There are many scenarios in which users must be able to prove the existence
    of data at a specific point in time and be able to demonstrate the integrity of
    data since that time, even when the duration from time of existence to time of
    demonstration spans a large period of time. Additionally, users must be able to
    verify signatures on digitally signed data many years after the generation of
    the signature. This document describes a class of long-term archive services to
    support such scenarios and the technical requirements for interacting with such
    services. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
