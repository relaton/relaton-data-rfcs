abstract:
- content: "<p>Time-Scheduled (TS) reservation of Traffic Engineering (TE) resources
    can be used to provide resource booking for TE Label Switched Paths so as to better
    guarantee services for customers and to improve the efficiency of network resource
    usage at any moment in time, including network usage that is planned for the future.
    \ This document provides a framework that describes and discusses the architecture
    for supporting scheduled reservation of TE resources.  This document does not
    describe specific protocols or protocol extensions needed to realize this service.</p>"
