abstract:
- content: "<p>When a Diameter server or agent becomes overloaded, it needs to be
    able to gracefully reduce its load, typically by advising clients to reduce traffic
    for some period of time.  Otherwise, it must continue to expend resources parsing
    and responding to Diameter messages, possibly resulting in a progressively severe
    overload condition.  The existing Diameter mechanisms are not sufficient for managing
    overload conditions.  This document describes the limitations of the existing
    mechanisms.  Requirements for new overload management mechanisms are also provided.</p>"
