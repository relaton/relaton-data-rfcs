abstract:
- content: "<p>Internet communications and applications have both environmental costs
    and benefits. The IAB ran an online workshop in December 2022 to explore and understand
    these impacts.</p><p>The role of the workshop was to discuss the impacts and the
    evolving industry needs, and to identify areas for improvements and future work.
    A key goal of the workshop was to call further attention to the topic and bring
    together a diverse stakeholder community to discuss these issues.</p><p>Note that
    this document is a report on the proceedings of the workshop. The views and positions
    documented in this report are those of the workshop participants and do not necessarily
    reflect IAB views and positions.</p>"
