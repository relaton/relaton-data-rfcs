abstract:
- content: <p>This memo explores the requirements for host configuration in IPsec
    tunnel mode, and describes how the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCPv4)
    may be leveraged for configuration.  In many remote access scenarios, a mechanism
    for making the remote host appear to be present on the local corporate network
    is quite useful.  This may be accomplished by assigning the host a "virtual" address
    from the corporate network, and then tunneling traffic via IPsec from the host's
    ISP-assigned address to the corporate security gateway.  In IPv4, DHCP provides
    for such remote host configuration. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
