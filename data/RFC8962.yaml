abstract:
- content: <p>One mantra of the IETF is, "We are not the Protocol Police." However,
    to ensure that protocols are implemented and deployed in full compliance with
    the IETF's standards, it is important to set up a body that is responsible for
    assessing and enforcing correct protocol behavior.</p><p>This document formally
    establishes the Protocol Police. It defines the body and sets out what aspects
    of IETF protocols they will police. This document acts as a point of reference
    for networking engineers, law enforcement officials, government representatives,
    and others. It also provides advice on how to report issues to the Protocol Police.</p>
