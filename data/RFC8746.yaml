abstract:
- content: "<p>The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR), as defined in RFC
    7049, is a data format whose design goals include the possibility of extremely
    small code size, fairly small message size, and extensibility without the need
    for version negotiation.</p><p>This document makes use of this extensibility to
    define a number of CBOR tags for typed arrays of numeric data, as well as additional
    tags for multi-dimensional and homogeneous arrays. It is intended as the reference
    document for the IANA registration of the CBOR tags defined.</p>"
