abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a framework for how the current IPv4 address
    space can be divided into two new address categories: a core address space (Area
    Locators, ALOCs) that is globally unique, and an edge address space (Endpoint
    Locators, ELOCs) that is regionally unique. In the future, the ELOC space will
    only be significant in a private network or in a service provider domain. Therefore,
    a 32x32 bit addressing scheme and a hierarchical routing architecture are achieved.
    The hierarchical IPv4 framework is backwards compatible with the current IPv4
    Internet.</p><p>This document also discusses a method for decoupling the location
    and identifier functions -- future applications can make use of the separation.
    The framework requires extensions to the existing Domain Name System (DNS), the
    existing IPv4 stack of the endpoints, middleboxes, and routers in the Internet.
    The framework can be implemented incrementally for endpoints, DNS, middleboxes,
    and routers. This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</p>"
