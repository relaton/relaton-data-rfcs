abstract:
- content: "<p>The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is a widely used transport for
    real-time multimedia on IP networks.  The Datagram Congestion Control Protocol
    (DCCP) is a transport protocol that provides desirable services for real-time
    applications.  This memo specifies a mapping of RTP onto DCCP, along with associated
    signalling, such that real- time applications can make use of the services provided
    by DCCP. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
