    Network Management Protocol), RSIP (Realm Specific Internet Protocol), Megaco,
    Diameter, and COPS (Common Open Policy Service) as the MIDCOM (Middlebox Communications)
    protocol.  A summary of each of the proposed protocols against the MIDCOM requirements
    and the MIDCOM framework is provided.  Compliancy of each of the protocols against
    each requirement is detailed.  A conclusion summarizes how each of the protocols
    fares in the evaluation.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
