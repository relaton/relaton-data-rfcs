abstract:
- content: <p>The "Trivial File Transfer Protocol" (RFC 1350) is a simple, lockstep,
    file transfer protocol that allows a client to get or put a file onto a remote
    host. One of its primary uses is in the early stages of nodes booting from a Local
    Area Network (LAN). TFTP has been used for this application because it is very
    simple to implement. The employment of a lockstep scheme limits throughput when
    used on a LAN.</p><p>This document describes a TFTP option that allows the client
    and server to negotiate a window size of consecutive blocks to send as an alternative
    for replacing the single-block lockstep schema. The TFTP option mechanism employed
    is described in "TFTP Option Extension" (RFC 2347).</p>
