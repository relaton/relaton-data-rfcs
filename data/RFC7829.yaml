abstract:
- content: <p>The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) supports multihoming.
    However, when the failover operation specified in RFC 4960 is followed, there
    can be significant delay and performance degradation in the data transfer path
    failover. This document specifies a quick failover algorithm and introduces the
    SCTP Potentially Failed (SCTP-PF) destination state in SCTP Path Management.</p><p>This
    document also specifies a dormant state operation of SCTP that is required to
    be followed by an SCTP-PF implementation, but it may equally well be applied by
    a standard SCTP implementation, as described in RFC 4960.</p><p>Additionally,
    this document introduces an alternative switchback operation mode called "Primary
    Path Switchover" that will be beneficial in certain situations. This mode of operation
    applies to both a standard SCTP implementation and an SCTP-PF implementation.</p><p>The
    procedures defined in the document require only minimal modifications to the specification
    in RFC 4960. The procedures are sender-side only and do not impact the SCTP receiver.</p>
