abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses the metrics to be considered in an evaluation
    of new or modified congestion control mechanisms for the Internet. These include
    metrics for the evaluation of new transport protocols, of proposed modifications
    to TCP, of application-level congestion control, and of Active Queue Management
    (AQM) mechanisms in the router. This document is the first in a series of documents
    aimed at improving the models that we use in the evaluation of transport protocols.</p><p>This
    document is a product of the Transport Modeling Research Group (TMRG), and has
    received detailed feedback from many members of the Research Group (RG). As the
    document tries to make clear, there is not necessarily a consensus within the
    research community (or the IETF community, the vendor community, the operations
    community, or any other community) about the metrics that congestion control mechanisms
    should be designed to optimize, in terms of trade-offs between throughput and
    delay, fairness between competing flows, and the like. However, we believe that
    there is a clear consensus that congestion control mechanisms should be evaluated
    in terms of trade-offs between a range of metrics, rather than in terms of optimizing
    for a single metric. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
