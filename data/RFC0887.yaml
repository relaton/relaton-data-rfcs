abstract:
- content: "<p>This RFC specifies a draft standard for the ARPA Internet community.
    \ It describes a resource location protocol for use in the ARPA Internet.  It
    is most useful on networks employing technologies which support some method of
    broadcast addressing, however it may also be used on other types of networks.
    \ For maximum benefit, all hosts which provide significant resources or services
    to other hosts on the Internet should implement this protocol.  Hosts failing
    to implement the Resource Location Protocol risk being ignored by other hosts
    which are attempting to locate resources on the Internet.</p>"
