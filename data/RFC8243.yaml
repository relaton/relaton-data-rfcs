abstract:
- content: "<p>Although TRILL is based on IS-IS, which supports multilevel unicast
    routing, extending TRILL to multiple levels has challenges that are not addressed
    by the already-existing capabilities of IS-IS. One issue is with the handling
    of multi-destination packet distribution trees. Other issues are with TRILL switch
    nicknames. How are such nicknames allocated across a multilevel TRILL network?
    Do nicknames need to be unique across an entire multilevel TRILL network? Or can
    they merely be unique within each multilevel area?</p><p>This informational document
    enumerates and examines alternatives based on a number of factors including backward
    compatibility, simplicity, and scalability; it makes recommendations in some cases.</p>"
