abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the requirements that individual Parallel NFS
    (pNFS) layout types need to meet in order to work within the pNFS framework as
    defined in RFC 5661.  In so doing, this document aims to clearly distinguish between
    requirements for pNFS as a whole and those specifically directed to the pNFS file
    layout.  The lack of a clear separation between the two sets of requirements has
    been troublesome for those specifying and evaluating new layout types.  In this
    regard, this document updates RFC 5661.</p>"
