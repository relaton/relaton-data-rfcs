abstract:
- content: "<p>Domain Name Registries (DNRs) may operate in special modes for certain
    periods of time, enabling trademark holders to protect their rights during the
    introduction of a Top-Level Domain (TLD).</p><p>One of those special modes of
    operation is the Sunrise Period. The Sunrise Period allows trademark holders an
    advance opportunity to register domain names corresponding to their trademarks
    before names are generally available to the public.</p><p>This document describes
    the format of a mark and a digitally signed mark used by trademark holders for
    registering domain names during the Sunrise Period of generic Top-Level Domains
    (gTLDs). Three types of Mark objects are defined in this specification: registered
    trademarks, court-validated marks, and marks protected by statue or treaty.</p>"
