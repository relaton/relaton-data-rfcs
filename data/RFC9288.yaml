abstract:
- content: "<p>This document analyzes the security implications of IPv6 Extension
    Headers and associated IPv6 options. Additionally, it discusses the operational
    and interoperability implications of discarding packets based on the IPv6 Extension
    Headers and IPv6 options they contain. Finally, it provides advice on the filtering
    of such IPv6 packets at transit routers for traffic not directed to them, for
    those cases where such filtering is deemed as necessary.</p>"
