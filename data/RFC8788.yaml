abstract:
- content: "<p>The 2020-2021 Nominating Committee (NomCom) is to be formed between
    the IETF 107 and IETF 108 meetings, and the issue of eligibility of who can serve
    on that NomCom needs clarification. This document provides a one-time interpretation
    of the eligibility rules that is required for the exceptional situation of the
    cancellation of the in-person IETF 107 meeting. This document only affects the
    seating of the 2020-2021 NomCom and any rules or processes that relate to NomCom
    eligibility before IETF 108; it does not set a precedent to be applied in the
    future.</p>"
