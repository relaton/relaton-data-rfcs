abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism to achieve device isolation through
    the application of special Layer 2 forwarding constraints. Such a mechanism allows
    end devices to share the same IP subnet while being Layer 2 isolated, which in
    turn allows network designers to employ larger subnets and so reduce the address
    management overhead.</p><p>Some of the numerous deployment scenarios of the aforementioned
    mechanism (which range from data center designs to Ethernet-to-the-home-basement
    networks) are mentioned in the following text to exemplify the mechanism's possible
    usages; however, this document is not intended to cover all such deployment scenarios
    nor delve into their details. This document is not an Internet Standards Track
    specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
