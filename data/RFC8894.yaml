abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the Simple Certificate Enrolment Protocol (SCEP),
    a PKI protocol that leverages existing technology by using Cryptographic Message
    Syntax (CMS, formerly known as PKCS #7) and PKCS #10 over HTTP.  SCEP is the evolution
    of the enrolment protocol sponsored by Cisco Systems, which enjoys wide support
    in both client and server implementations, as well as being relied upon by numerous
    other industry standards that work with certificates.</p>"
