abstract:
- content: "<p>The Network Service Header (NSH) specification defines two possible
    methods of including metadata (MD): MD Type 0x1 and MD Type 0x2. MD Type 0x1 uses
    a fixed-length Context Header. The allocation of this Context Header, i.e., its
    structure and semantics, has not been standardized. This memo defines the Timestamp
    Context Header, which is an NSH fixed-length Context Header that incorporates
    the packet's timestamp, a sequence number, and a source interface identifier.</p><p>Although
    the definition of the Context Header presented in this document has not been standardized
    by the IETF, it has been implemented in silicon by several manufacturers and is
    published here to facilitate interoperability.</p>"
