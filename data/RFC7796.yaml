abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a generic Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS)
    solution, which uses VLANs to indicate root or leaf traffic to support Ethernet-Tree
    (E-Tree) services.  A VPLS Provider Edge (PE) model is illustrated as an example
    for the solution.  In the solution, E-Tree VPLS PEs are interconnected by Pseudowires
    (PWs), which carry the VLAN indicating the E-Tree attribute.  The MAC address-based
    Ethernet forwarding engine and the PW work in the same way as specified in RFC
    4762 and RFC 4448, respectively.  A signaling mechanism is described to support
    E-Tree capability and VLAN mapping negotiation.</p>"
