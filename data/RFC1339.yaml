abstract:
- content: "<p>This RFC defines a protocol to provide a mail checking service to be
    used between a client and server pair.  Typically, a small program on a client
    workstation would use the protocol to query a server in order to find out whether
    new mail has arrived for a specified user.  This memo defines an Experimental
    Protocol for the Internet community.</p>"
