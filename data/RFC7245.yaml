abstract:
- content: "<p>Session recording is a critical requirement in many communications
    environments such as call centers and financial trading.  In some of these environments,
    all calls must be recorded for regulatory, compliance, and consumer protection
    reasons.  Recording of a session is typically performed by sending a copy of a
    media stream to a recording device.  This document describes architectures for
    deploying session recording solutions in an environment that is based on the Session
    Initiation Protocol (SIP).</p>"
