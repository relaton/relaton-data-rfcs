abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the WITHIN extension to IMAP SEARCH.  IMAP
    SEARCH returns messages whose internal date is within or outside a specified interval.
    \ The mechanism described here, OLDER and YOUNGER, differs from BEFORE and SINCE
    in that the client specifies an interval, rather than a date.  WITHIN is useful
    for persistent searches where either the device does not have the capacity to
    perform the search at regular intervals or the network is of limited bandwidth
    and thus there is a desire to reduce network traffic from sending repeated requests
    and redundant responses. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
