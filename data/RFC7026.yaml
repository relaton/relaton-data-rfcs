abstract:
- content: "<p>The MPLS Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh) is a generalization of
    the applicability of the pseudowire (PW) Associated Channel Header (ACH). RFC
    5586 defines the concept of TLV constructs that can be carried in messages on
    the G-ACh by placing them in the ACH between the fixed header fields and the G-ACh
    message. These TLVs are called ACH TLVs</p><p>No Associated Channel Type yet defined
    uses an ACH TLV. Furthermore, it is believed that handling TLVs in hardware introduces
    significant problems to the fast path, and since G-ACh messages are intended to
    be processed substantially in hardware, the use of ACH TLVs is undesirable.</p><p>This
    document updates RFC 5586 by retiring ACH TLVs and removing the associated registry.</p>"
