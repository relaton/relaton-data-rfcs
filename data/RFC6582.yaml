abstract:
- content: '<p>RFC 5681 documents the following four intertwined TCP congestion control
    algorithms: slow start, congestion avoidance, fast retransmit, and fast recovery.  RFC
    5681 explicitly allows certain modifications of these algorithms, including modifications
    that use the TCP Selective Acknowledgment (SACK) option (RFC 2883), and modifications
    that respond to "partial acknowledgments" (ACKs that cover new data, but not all
    the data outstanding when loss was detected) in the absence of SACK.  This document
    describes a specific algorithm for responding to partial acknowledgments, referred
    to as "NewReno".  This response to partial acknowledgments was first proposed
    by Janey Hoe.  This document obsoletes RFC 3782. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>'
