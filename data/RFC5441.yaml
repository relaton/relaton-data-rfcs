abstract:
- content: "<p>The ability to compute shortest constrained Traffic Engineering Label
    Switched Paths (TE LSPs) in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized
    MPLS (GMPLS) networks across multiple domains has been identified as a key requirement.
    \ In this context, a domain is a collection of network elements within a common
    sphere of address management or path computational responsibility such as an IGP
    area or an Autonomous Systems.  This document specifies a procedure relying on
    the use of multiple Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to compute such inter-domain
    shortest constrained paths across a predetermined sequence of domains, using a
    backward-recursive path computation technique.  This technique preserves confidentiality
    across domains, which is sometimes required when domains are managed by different
    service providers. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
