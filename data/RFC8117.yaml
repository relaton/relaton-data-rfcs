abstract:
- content: "<p>Giving a hostname to your computer and publishing it as you roam from
    one network to another is the Internet's equivalent of walking around with a name
    tag affixed to your lapel. This current practice can significantly compromise
    your privacy, and something should change in order to mitigate these privacy threats.</p><p>There
    are several possible remedies, such as fixing a variety of protocols or avoiding
    disclosing a hostname at all. This document describes some of the protocols that
    reveal hostnames today and sketches another possible remedy, which is to replace
    static hostnames by frequently changing randomized values.</p>"
