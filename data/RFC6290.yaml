abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an extension to the Internet Key Exchange Protocol
    version 2 (IKEv2) that allows for faster detection of Security Association (SA)
    desynchronization using a saved token.</p><p>When an IPsec tunnel between two
    IKEv2 peers is disconnected due to a restart of one peer, it can take as much
    as several minutes for the other peer to discover that the reboot has occurred,
    thus delaying recovery. In this text, we propose an extension to the protocol
    that allows for recovery immediately following the restart. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
