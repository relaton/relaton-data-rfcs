    Gateway Protocol in the Internet. This is an official policy statement of ICCB
    and DARPA. After 1-Aug-84 there shall be no dumb gateways in the Internet. Every
    gateway must be a member of some autonomous system. Some gateway of each autonomous
    system must exchange routing information with some gateway of the core autonomous
    system using the Exterior Gateway Protocol.</p>"
