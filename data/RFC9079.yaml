- content: "<p>Source-specific routing, also known as Source Address Dependent Routing
    (SADR), is an extension to traditional next-hop routing where packets are forwarded
    according to both their destination address and their source address.  This document
    describes an extension for source-specific routing to the Babel routing protocol.</p>"
