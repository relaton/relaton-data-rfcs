abstract:
- content: "<p>There appears to be some interest in experimenting with subnetting
    the class A addresses.  It is suggested that conducting an experiment now to identify
    and fix any software that does not properly handle subnetted class A addresses
    would be useful and important.  This document defines an Experimental Protocol
    for the Internet community.  This does not specify an Internet standard of any
    kind.</p>"
