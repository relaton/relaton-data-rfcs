abstract:
- content: <p>OpenPGP is a message format for email (and file) encryption that lacks
    a standardized lookup mechanism to securely obtain OpenPGP public keys.  DNS-Based
    Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) is a method for publishing public keys
    in DNS.  This document specifies a DANE method for publishing and locating OpenPGP
    public keys in DNS for a specific email address using a new OPENPGPKEY DNS resource
    record.  Security is provided via Secure DNS, however the OPENPGPKEY record is
    not a replacement for verification of authenticity via the "web of trust" or manual
    verification.  The OPENPGPKEY record can be used to encrypt an email that would
    otherwise have to be sent unencrypted.</p>
