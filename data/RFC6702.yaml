abstract:
- content: "<p>The disclosure process for intellectual property rights (IPR) in documents
    produced within the IETF stream is essential to the accurate development of community
    consensus.  However, this process is not always followed by IETF participants.
    \ Regardless of the cause or motivation, noncompliance with IPR disclosure rules
    can delay or even derail completion of IETF specifications.  This document describes
    some strategies for promoting compliance with the IPR disclosure rules.  These
    strategies are primarily intended for use by area directors, working group chairs,
    and working group secretaries.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track
    specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
