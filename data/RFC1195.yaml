abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo specifies an integrated routing protocol, based on the OSI
    Intra-Domain IS-IS Routing Protocol, which may be used as an interior gateway
    protocol (IGP) to support TCP/IP as well as OSI. This allows a single routing
    protocol to be used to support pure IP environments, pure OSI environments, and
    dual environments. This specification was developed by the IS-IS working group
    of the Internet Engineering Task Force. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
