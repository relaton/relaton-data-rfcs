abstract:
- content: <p>The 6bone was established in 1996 by the IETF as an IPv6 Testbed network
    to enable various IPv6 testing as well as to assist in the transitioning of IPv6
    into the Internet. It operates under the IPv6 address allocation 3FFE::/16 from
    RFC 2471. As IPv6 is beginning its production deployment it is appropriate to
    plan for the phaseout of the 6bone. This document establishes a plan for a multi-year
    phaseout of the 6bone and its address allocation on the assumption that the IETF
    is the appropriate place to determine this. This document obsoletes RFC 2471,
    "IPv6 Testing Address Allocation", December, 1998. RFC 2471 will become historic.
    This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>
