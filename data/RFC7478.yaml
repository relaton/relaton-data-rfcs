abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes web-based real-time communication use cases.
    Requirements on the browser functionality are derived from the use cases.</p><p>This
    document was developed in an initial phase of the work with rather minor updates
    at later stages. It has not really served as a tool in deciding features or scope
    for the WG's efforts so far. It is being published to record the early conclusions
    of the WG. It will not be used as a set of rigid guidelines that specifications
    and implementations will be held to in the future.</p>"
