abstract:
- content: "<p>In certain environments, e.g., large-scale virtualization deployments,
    new devices are created in an automated manner. Such devices may have their link-layer
    addresses assigned in an automated fashion. With sufficient scale, the likelihood
    of a collision using random assignment without duplication detection is not acceptable.
    Therefore, an allocation mechanism is required. This document proposes an extension
    to DHCPv6 that allows a scalable approach to link-layer address assignments where
    preassigned link-layer address assignments (such as by a manufacturer) are not
    possible or are unnecessary.</p>"
