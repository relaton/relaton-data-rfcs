abstract:
- content: "<p>Internet users are becoming more aware that their activity over the
    Internet leaves a vast digital footprint, that communications might not always
    be properly secured, and that their location and actions can be tracked. One of
    the main factors that eases tracking of Internet users is the wide use of long-lasting,
    and sometimes persistent, identifiers at various protocol layers. This document
    focuses on Media Access Control (MAC) addresses.</p><p>There have been several
    initiatives within the IETF and the IEEE 802 standards committees to address some
    of the privacy issues involved. This document provides an overview of these activities
    to help coordinate standardization activities in these bodies.</p>"
