abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies how a child zone in the DNS can publish a record
    to indicate to a parental agent that the parental agent may copy and process certain
    records from the child zone.  The existence of the record and any change in its
    value can be monitored by a parental agent and acted on depending on local policy.</p>"
