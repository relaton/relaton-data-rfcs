abstract:
- content: <p>Mobile IPv6 enables a Mobile Node to maintain its connectivity to the
    Internet when moving from one Access Router to another, a process referred to
    as handover.  During handover, there is a period during which the Mobile Node
    is unable to send or receive packets because of link switching delay and IP protocol
    operations.  This "handover latency" resulting from standard Mobile IPv6 procedures,
    namely movement detection, new Care of Address configuration, and Binding Update,
    is often unacceptable to real-time traffic such as Voice over IP.  Reducing the
    handover latency could be beneficial to non-real-time, throughput-sensitive applications
    as well.  This document specifies a protocol to improve handover latency due to
    Mobile IPv6 procedures.  This document does not address improving the link switching
    latency.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</p>
