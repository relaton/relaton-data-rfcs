abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines the protocol to be used for a new network
    service called Low Latency, Low Loss, and Scalable throughput (L4S). L4S uses
    an Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) scheme at the IP layer that is similar
    to the original (or 'Classic') ECN approach, except as specified within. L4S uses
    'Scalable' congestion control, which induces much more frequent control signals
    from the network, and it responds to them with much more fine-grained adjustments
    so that very low (typically sub-millisecond on average) and consistently low queuing
    delay becomes possible for L4S traffic without compromising link utilization.
    Thus, even capacity-seeking (TCP-like) traffic can have high bandwidth and very
    low delay at the same time, even during periods of high traffic load.</p><p>The
    L4S identifier defined in this document distinguishes L4S from 'Classic' (e.g.,
    TCP-Reno-friendly) traffic. Then, network bottlenecks can be incrementally modified
    to distinguish and isolate existing traffic that still follows the Classic behaviour,
    to prevent it from degrading the low queuing delay and low loss of L4S traffic.
    This Experimental specification defines the rules that L4S transports and network
    elements need to follow, with the intention that L4S flows neither harm each other's
    performance nor that of Classic traffic. It also suggests open questions to be
    investigated during experimentation. Examples of new Active Queue Management (AQM)
    marking algorithms and new transports (whether TCP-like or real time) are specified
    separately.</p>"
