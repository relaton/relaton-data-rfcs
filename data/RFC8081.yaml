abstract:
- content: <p>This memo serves to register and document the "font" top-level media
    type, under which subtypes for representation formats for fonts may be registered.  This
    document also serves as a registration application for a set of intended subtypes,
    which are representative of some existing subtypes already in use, and currently
    registered under the "application" tree by their separate registrations.</p>
