abstract:
- content: "<p>This is an informational document that describes the transport protocol
    interface primitives provided by the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and the Lightweight
    User Datagram Protocol (UDP-Lite) transport protocols.  It identifies the datagram
    services exposed to applications and how an application can configure and use
    the features offered by the Internet datagram transport service.  RFC 8303 documents
    the usage of transport features provided by IETF transport protocols, describing
    the way UDP, UDP-Lite, and other transport protocols expose their services to
    applications and how an application can configure and use the features that make
    up these services.  This document provides input to and context for that document,
    as well as offers a road map to documentation that may help users of the UDP and
    UDP-Lite protocols.</p>"
