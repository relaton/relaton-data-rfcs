abstract:
- content: "<p>A mobile node needs at least the following information: a home address,
    a home agent address, and a security association with home agent to register with
    the home agent.  The process of obtaining this information is called bootstrapping.
    \ This document discusses issues involved with how the mobile node can be bootstrapped
    for Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) and various potential deployment scenarios for mobile
    node bootstrapping.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
