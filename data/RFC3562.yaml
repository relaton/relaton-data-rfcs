abstract:
- content: "<p>The TCP MD5 Signature Option (RFC 2385), used predominantly by BGP,
    has seen significant deployment in critical areas of Internet infrastructure.
    \ The security of this option relies heavily on the quality of the keying material
    used to compute the MD5 signature.  This document addresses the security requirements
    of that keying material.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
