abstract:
- content: "<p>This survey determines how many hosts are able to respond to TELENET
    connections from a user at a class C site. This requires, in addition to IP and
    TCP, participation in gateway routing via ICMP and handling of Class C addresses.
    The list of hosts was taken from RFC 843, extracting only those hosts which are
    listed there as accepting TELNET connection. The tests were run on 18-Feb-83.</p>"
