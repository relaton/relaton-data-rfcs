abstract:
- content: "<p>Recent research work has explored the deployment characteristics and
    configuration of the Domain Name System (DNS). This document summarizes the conclusions
    from these research efforts and offers specific, tangible considerations or advice
    to authoritative DNS server operators. Authoritative server operators may wish
    to follow these considerations to improve their DNS services.</p><p>It is possible
    that the results presented in this document could be applicable in a wider context
    than just the DNS protocol, as some of the results may generically apply to any
    stateless/short-duration anycasted service.</p><p>This document is not an IETF
    consensus document: it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
