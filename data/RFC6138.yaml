abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 5443 describes a mechanism to achieve LDP IGP synchronization to
    prevent black-holing traffic (e.g., VPN) when an Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP)
    is operational on a link but Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) is not. If this
    mechanism is applied to broadcast links that have more than one LDP peer, the
    metric increase procedure can only be applied to the link as a whole but not to
    an individual peer. When a new LDP peer comes up on a broadcast network, this
    can result in loss of traffic through other established peers on that network.
    This document describes a mechanism to address that use-case without dropping
    traffic. The mechanism does not introduce any protocol message changes. This document
    is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational
    purposes.</p>"
