abstract:
- content: "<p>Although Internet message formats have been precisely defined since
    the 1970s, authoring and handling software often shows only mild conformance to
    the specifications.  The malformed messages that result are non-standard.  Nonetheless,
    decades of experience have shown that using some tolerance in the handling of
    the malformations that result is often an acceptable approach and is better than
    rejecting the messages outright as nonconformant.  This document includes a collection
    of the best advice available regarding a variety of common malformed mail situations;
    it is to be used as implementation guidance.</p>"
