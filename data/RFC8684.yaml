abstract:
- content: "<p>TCP/IP communication is currently restricted to a single path per connection,
    yet multiple paths often exist between peers. The simultaneous use of these multiple
    paths for a TCP/IP session would improve resource usage within the network and
    thus improve user experience through higher throughput and improved resilience
    to network failure.</p><p>Multipath TCP provides the ability to simultaneously
    use multiple paths between peers. This document presents a set of extensions to
    traditional TCP to support multipath operation. The protocol offers the same type
    of service to applications as TCP (i.e., a reliable bytestream), and it provides
    the components necessary to establish and use multiple TCP flows across potentially
    disjoint paths.</p><p>This document specifies v1 of Multipath TCP, obsoleting
    v0 as specified in RFC 6824, through clarifications and modifications primarily
    driven by deployment experience.</p>"
