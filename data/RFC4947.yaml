abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the process of binding/associating IPv4/IPv6
    addresses with MPEG-2 Transport Streams (TS). This procedure is known as Address
    Resolution (AR) or Neighbor Discovery (ND). Such address resolution complements
    the higher-layer resource discovery tools that are used to advertise IP sessions.</p><p>In
    MPEG-2 Networks, an IP address must be associated with a Packet ID (PID) value
    and a specific Transmission Multiplex. This document reviews current methods appropriate
    to a range of technologies (such as DVB (Digital Video Broadcasting), ATSC (Advanced
    Television Systems Committee), DOCSIS (Data-Over-Cable Service Interface Specifications),
    and variants). It also describes the interaction with well-known protocols for
    address management including DHCP, ARP, and the ND protocol. This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.</p>"
