abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines basic terminology for describing different types
    of Network Address Translation (NAT) behavior when handling Unicast UDP and also
    defines a set of requirements that would allow many applications, such as multimedia
    communications or online gaming, to work consistently. Developing NATs that meet
    this set of requirements will greatly increase the likelihood that these applications
    will function properly. This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices
    for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.</p>"
