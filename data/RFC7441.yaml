abstract:
- content: <p>Many service providers offer "BGP/MPLS IP VPN" service to their customers.  Existing
    IETF standards specify the procedures and protocols that a service provider uses
    in order to offer this service to customers who have IP unicast and IP multicast
    traffic in their VPNs.  It is also desirable to be able to support customers who
    have MPLS multicast traffic in their VPNs.  This document specifies the procedures
    and protocol extensions that are needed to support customers who use the Multipoint
    LDP (mLDP) as the control protocol for their MPLS multicast traffic.  Existing
    standards do provide some support for customers who use mLDP, but only under a
    restrictive set of circumstances.  This document generalizes the existing support
    to include all cases where the customer uses mLDP, without any restrictions.  This
    document updates RFC 6514.</p>
