abstract:
- content: "<p>Many IMAP clients display information about total number of messages
    / total number of unseen messages in IMAP mailboxes.  In order to do that, they
    are forced to issue a LIST or LSUB command and to list all available mailboxes,
    followed by a STATUS command for each mailbox found.  This document provides an
    extension to LIST command that allows the client to request STATUS information
    for mailboxes together with other information typically returned by the LIST command.
