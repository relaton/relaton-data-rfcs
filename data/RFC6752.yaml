abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of this document is to provide a discussion of the potential
    problems of using private, RFC 1918, or non-globally routable addressing within
    the core of a Service Provider (SP) network.  The discussion focuses on link addresses
    and, to a small extent, loopback addresses.  While many of the issues are well
    recognised within the ISP community, there appears to be no document that collectively
    describes the issues.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;
    it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
