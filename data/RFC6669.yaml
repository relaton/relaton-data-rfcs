abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides an overview of the Operations, Administration,
    and Maintenance (OAM) toolset for MPLS-based transport networks.  The toolset
    consists of a comprehensive set of fault management and performance monitoring
    capabilities (operating in the data plane) that are appropriate for transport
    networks as required in RFC 5860 and support the network and services at different
    nested levels.  This overview includes a brief recap of the MPLS Transport Profile
    (MPLS-TP) OAM requirements and functions and the generic mechanisms created in
    the MPLS data plane that allow the OAM packets to run in-band and share their
    fate with data packets.  The protocol definitions for each of the MPLS-TP OAM
    tools are defined in separate documents (RFCs or Working Group documents), which
    are referenced by this document.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track
    specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
