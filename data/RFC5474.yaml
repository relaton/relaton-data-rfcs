abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a framework for the PSAMP (Packet SAMPling)
    protocol.  The functions of this protocol are to select packets from a stream
    according to a set of standardized Selectors, to form a stream of reports on the
    selected packets, and to export the reports to a Collector.  This framework details
    the components of this architecture, then describes some generic requirements,
    motivated by the dual aims of ubiquitous deployment and utility of the reports
    for applications.  Detailed requirements for selection, reporting, and exporting
    are described, along with configuration requirements of the PSAMP functions.  This
    memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
