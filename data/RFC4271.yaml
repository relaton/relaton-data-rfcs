abstract:
- content: <p>This document discusses the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), which is
    an inter-Autonomous System routing protocol.</p><p>The primary function of a BGP
    speaking system is to exchange network reachability information with other BGP
    systems. This network reachability information includes information on the list
    of Autonomous Systems (ASes) that reachability information traverses. This information
    is sufficient for constructing a graph of AS connectivity for this reachability
    from which routing loops may be pruned, and, at the AS level, some policy decisions
    may be enforced.</p><p>BGP-4 provides a set of mechanisms for supporting Classless
    Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR). These mechanisms include support for advertising
    a set of destinations as an IP prefix, and eliminating the concept of network
    "class" within BGP. BGP-4 also introduces mechanisms that allow aggregation of
    routes, including aggregation of AS paths.</p><p>This document obsoletes RFC 1771.
