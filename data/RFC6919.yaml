abstract:
- content: <p>RFC 2119 defines a standard set of key words for describing requirements
    of a specification. Many IETF documents have found that these words cannot accurately
    capture the nuanced requirements of their specification. This document defines
    additional key words that can be used to address alternative requirements scenarios.
    Authors who follow these guidelines should incorporate this phrase near the beginning
    of their document:</p><p>The key words "MUST (BUT WE KNOW YOU WON\'T)", "SHOULD
    CONSIDER", "REALLY SHOULD NOT", "OUGHT TO", "WOULD PROBABLY", "MAY WISH TO", "COULD",
    "POSSIBLE", and "MIGHT" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
    RFC 6919.</p>
