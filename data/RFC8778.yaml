- content: "<p>This document specifies the conventions for using the Hierarchical
    Signature System (HSS) / Leighton-Micali Signature (LMS) hash-based signature
    algorithm with the CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) syntax.  The HSS/LMS
    algorithm is one form of hash-based digital signature; it is described in RFC
    8554.</p>"
