abstract:
- content: "<p>Operators worldwide are in various stages of preparing for or deploying
    IPv6 in their networks. These operators often face difficult challenges related
    to IPv6 introduction, along with those related to IPv4 run-out. Operators will
    need to meet the simultaneous needs of IPv6 connectivity and continue support
    for IPv4 connectivity for legacy devices with a stagnant supply of IPv4 addresses.
    The IPv6 transition will take most networks from an IPv4- only environment to
    an IPv6-dominant environment with long transition periods varying by operator.
    This document helps provide a framework for wireline providers who are faced with
    the challenges of introducing IPv6 along with meeting the legacy needs of IPv4
    connectivity, utilizing well-defined and commercially available IPv6 transition
    technologies. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;
    it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
