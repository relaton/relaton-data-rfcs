abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces a new class of Model-Based Metrics designed
    to assess if a complete Internet path can be expected to meet a predefined Target
    Transport Performance by applying a suite of IP diagnostic tests to successive
    subpaths. The subpath-at-a-time tests can be robustly applied to critical infrastructure,
    such as network interconnections or even individual devices, to accurately detect
    if any part of the infrastructure will prevent paths traversing it from meeting
    the Target Transport Performance.</p><p>Model-Based Metrics rely on mathematical
    models to specify a Targeted IP Diagnostic Suite, a set of IP diagnostic tests
    designed to assess whether common transport protocols can be expected to meet
    a predetermined Target Transport Performance over an Internet path.</p><p>For
    Bulk Transport Capacity, the IP diagnostics are built using test streams and statistical
    criteria for evaluating the packet transfer that mimic TCP over the complete path.
    The temporal structure of the test stream (e.g., bursts) mimics TCP or other transport
    protocols carrying bulk data over a long path. However, they are constructed to
    be independent of the details of the subpath under test, end systems, or applications.
    Likewise, the success criteria evaluates the packet transfer statistics of the
    subpath against criteria determined by protocol performance models applied to
    the Target Transport Performance of the complete path. The success criteria also
    does not depend on the details of the subpath, end systems, or applications.</p>"
