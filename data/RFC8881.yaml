abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Network File System (NFS) version 4 minor
    version 1, including features retained from the base protocol (NFS version 4 minor
    version 0, which is specified in RFC 7530) and protocol extensions made subsequently.
    The later minor version has no dependencies on NFS version 4 minor version 0,
    and is considered a separate protocol.</p><p>This document obsoletes RFC 5661.
    It substantially revises the treatment of features relating to multi-server namespace,
    superseding the description of those features appearing in RFC 5661.</p>"
