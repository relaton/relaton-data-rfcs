abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the use of QUIC to provide transport confidentiality
    for DNS.  The encryption provided by QUIC has similar properties to those provided
    by TLS, while QUIC transport eliminates the head-of-line blocking issues inherent
    with TCP and provides more efficient packet-loss recovery than UDP.  DNS over
    QUIC (DoQ) has privacy properties similar to DNS over TLS (DoT) specified in RFC
    7858, and latency characteristics similar to classic DNS over UDP.  This specification
    describes the use of DoQ as a general-purpose transport for DNS and includes the
    use of DoQ for stub to recursive, recursive to authoritative, and zone transfer
    scenarios.</p>"
