- content: '<p>This informational RFC describes the conventions to be followed by
    those in charge of networks and hosts in the Internet. It is a summary of the

    is a contribution by the author of his view of these conventions. It is expected
    that this RFC will provide a basis for the development of official policies in
    the future.] These conventions may be supplemented or amended by the policies
    of specific local and regional components of the Internet. This RFC does not specify
    a standard, or a policy of the IAB.</p>'
