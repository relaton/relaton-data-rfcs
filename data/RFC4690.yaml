abstract:
- content: "<p>This note describes issues raised by the deployment and use of Internationalized
    Domain Names.  It describes problems both at the time of registration and for
    use of those names in the DNS.  It recommends that IETF should update the RFCs
    relating to IDNs and a framework to be followed in doing so, as well as summarizing
    and identifying some work that is required outside the IETF.  In particular, it
    proposes that some changes be investigated for the Internationalizing Domain Names
    in Applications (IDNA) standard and its supporting tables, based on experience
    gained since those standards were completed.  This memo provides information for
    the Internet community.</p>"
