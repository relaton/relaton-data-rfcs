abstract:
- content: "<p>This document analyzes actions by or against a Certification Authority
    (CA) or an independent repository manager in the RPKI that can adversely affect
    the Internet Number Resources (INRs) associated with that CA or its subordinate
    CAs.  The analysis is done from the perspective of an affected INR holder.  The
    analysis is based on examination of the data items in the RPKI repository, as
    controlled by a CA (or an independent repository manager) and fetched by Relying
    Parties (RPs).  The analysis does not purport to be comprehensive; it does represent
    an orderly way to analyze a number of ways that errors by or attacks against a
    CA or repository manager can affect the RPKI and routing decisions based on RPKI
    data.</p>"
