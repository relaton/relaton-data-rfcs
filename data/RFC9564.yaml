abstract:
- content: "<p>The recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) such as large language
    models enable the design of the Faster than LIght speed Protocol (FLIP) for Internet.
    FLIP provides a way to avoid congestion, enhance security, and deliver faster
    packets on the Internet by using AI to predict future packets at the receiving
    peer before they arrive. This document describes the protocol, its various encapsulations,
    and some operational considerations.</p>"
