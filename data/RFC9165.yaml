abstract:
- content: <p>The Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL), standardized in RFC 8610,
    provides "control operators" as its main language extension point.</p><p>The present
    document defines a number of control operators that were not yet ready at the
    time RFC 8610 was completed:,, and for the construction of constants; / for including
    ABNF (RFC 5234 and RFC 7405) in CDDL specifications; and for indicating the use
    of a non-basic feature in an instance.</p>
