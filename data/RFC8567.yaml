abstract:
- content: "<p>Maintaining high Quality of Experience (QoE) increasingly requires
    end-to-end, holistic network management, including managed Customer Premises Equipment
    (CPE). Because customer management is a shared global responsibility, the Domain
    Name System (DNS) provides an ideal existing infrastructure for maintaining authoritative
    customer information that must be readily, reliably, and publicly accessible.</p><p>This
    document describes four new DNS resource record types for encoding customer information
    in the DNS. These records are intended to better facilitate high customer QoE
    via inter-provider cooperation and management of customer data.</p>"
