abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo contains the thoughts and recountings of events that transpired
    during and after the release of information about the United States National Security
    Agency (NSA) by Edward Snowden in 2013. There are four perspectives: that of someone
    who was involved with sifting through the information to responsibly inform the
    public, that of a security area director of the IETF, that of a human rights expert,
    and that of a computer science and affiliate law professor. The purpose of this
    memo is to provide some historical perspective, while at the same time offering
    a view as to what security and privacy challenges the technical community should
    consider. These essays do not represent a consensus view, but that of the individual
    authors.</p>"
