abstract:
- content: "<p>Over the last decade, a substantial amount of work has occurred in
    the space of federated access management. Most of this effort has focused on two
    use cases: network access and web-based access. However, the solutions to these
    use cases that have been proposed and deployed tend to have few building blocks
    in common.</p><p>This memo describes an architecture that makes use of extensions
    to the commonly used security mechanisms for both federated and non-federated
    access management, including the Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS),
    the Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API), the Extensible
    Authentication Protocol (EAP), and the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML).
    The architecture addresses the problem of federated access management to primarily
    non-web-based services, in a manner that will scale to large numbers of Identity
    Providers, Relying Parties, and federations.</p>"
