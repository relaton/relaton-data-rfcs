abstract:
- content: "<p>Three Letter Acronyms (TLAs) are commonly used to identify components
    of networks or protocols as designed or specified within the IETF. A common concern
    is that one acronym may have multiple expansions. While this may not have been
    an issue in the past, network convergence means that protocols that did not previously
    operate together are now found in close proximity. This results in contention
    for acronyms, and confusion in interpretation. Such confusion has the potential
    to degrade the performance of the Internet as misunderstandings lead to misconfiguration
    or other operating errors.</p><p>Given the growing use of TLAs and the relatively
    small number available, this document specifies a Badly Construed Proposal (BCP)
    for the management of a registry of TLAs within the IETF, and the procedures for
    the allocation of new TLAs from the registry. This memo provides information for
    the Internet community.</p>"
