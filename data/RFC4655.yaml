abstract:
- content: "<p>Constraint-based path computation is a fundamental building block for
    traffic engineering systems such as Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized
    Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) networks. Path computation in large, multi-domain,
    multi-region, or multi-layer networks is complex and may require special computational
    components and cooperation between the different network domains.</p><p>This document
    specifies the architecture for a Path Computation Element (PCE)-based model to
    address this problem space. This document does not attempt to provide a detailed
    description of all the architectural components, but rather it describes a set
    of building blocks for the PCE architecture from which solutions may be constructed.
    This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
