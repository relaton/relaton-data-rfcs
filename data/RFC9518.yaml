abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses aspects of centralization that relate to Internet
    standards efforts. It argues that, while standards bodies have a limited ability
    to prevent many forms of centralization, they can still make contributions that
    assist in the decentralization of the Internet.</p>"
