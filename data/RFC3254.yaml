abstract:
- content: <p>When discussing systems for making information accessible through the
    Internet in standardized ways, it may be useful if the people who are discussing
    it have a common understanding of the terms they use.  For example, a reference
    to this document would give one the power to agree that the DNS (Domain Name System)
    is a global lookup repository with perimeter integrity and loose, converging consistency.  On
    the other hand, a LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) directory server
    is a local, centralized repository with both lookup and search capability.  This
    document discusses one group of such systems which is known under the term, "directories".  This
    memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>
