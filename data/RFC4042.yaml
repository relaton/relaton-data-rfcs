abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO-10646 defines a large character set called the Universal Character
    Set (UCS), which encompasses most of the world's writing systems. The same set
    of codepoints is defined by Unicode, which further defines additional character
    properties and other implementation details. By policy of the relevant standardization
    committees, changes to Unicode and amendments and additions to ISO/IEC 10646 track
    each other, so that the character repertoires and code point assignments remain
    in synchronization.</p><p>The current representation formats for Unicode (UTF-7,
    UTF-8, UTF-16) are not storage and computation efficient on platforms that utilize
    the 9 bit nonet as a natural storage unit instead of the 8 bit octet.</p><p>This
    document describes a transformation format of Unicode that takes advantage of
    the nonet so that the format will be storage and computation efficient. This memo
    provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
