abstract:
- content: "<p>The Peer-to-Peer Streaming Peer Protocol (PPSPP) is a protocol for
    disseminating the same content to a group of interested parties in a streaming
    fashion.  PPSPP supports streaming of both prerecorded (on- demand) and live audio/video
    content.  It is based on the peer-to- peer paradigm, where clients consuming the
    content are put on equal footing with the servers initially providing the content,
    to create a system where everyone can potentially provide upload bandwidth.  It
    has been designed to provide short time-till-playback for the end user and to
    prevent disruption of the streams by malicious peers.  PPSPP has also been designed
    to be flexible and extensible.  It can use different mechanisms to optimize peer
    uploading, prevent freeriding, and work with different peer discovery schemes
    (centralized trackers or Distributed Hash Tables).  It supports multiple methods
    for content integrity protection and chunk addressing.  Designed as a generic
    protocol that can run on top of various transport protocols, it currently runs
    on top of UDP using Low Extra Delay Background Transport (LEDBAT) for congestion
    control.</p>"
