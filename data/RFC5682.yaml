abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of this document is to move the F-RTO (Forward RTO-Recovery)
    functionality for TCP in RFC 4138 from Experimental to Standards Track status.
    The F-RTO support for Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) in RFC 4138
    remains with Experimental status. See Appendix B for the differences between this
    document and RFC 4138.</p><p>Spurious retransmission timeouts cause suboptimal
    TCP performance because they often result in unnecessary retransmission of the
    last window of data. This document describes the F-RTO detection algorithm for
    detecting spurious TCP retransmission timeouts. F-RTO is a TCP sender-only algorithm
    that does not require any TCP options to operate. After retransmitting the first
    unacknowledged segment triggered by a timeout, the F-RTO algorithm of the TCP
    sender monitors the incoming acknowledgments to determine whether the timeout
    was spurious. It then decides whether to send new segments or retransmit unacknowledged
    segments. The algorithm effectively helps to avoid additional unnecessary retransmissions
    and thereby improves TCP performance in the case of a spurious timeout. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
