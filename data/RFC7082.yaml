abstract:
- content: <p>The Centralized Conferencing Manipulation Protocol (CCMP) document (RFC
    6503) defines a way for a client to discover a conference control server that
    supports CCMP. However, it does not define a way for a client involved in a conference
    to determine if the conference focus supports CCMP. This information would allow
    a CCMP-enabled client that joins a conference using SIP to also register for the
    Centralized Conferencing (XCON) conference event package and take advantage of
    CCMP operations on the conference.</p><p>This document describes two mechanisms,
    depending upon the need of the User Agent (UA), to address the above limitation.
    The first mechanism uses the Call-Info header field, and the second mechanism
    defines a new value for the "purpose" header field parameter in the   element
    in the SIP conferencing event package.</p>
