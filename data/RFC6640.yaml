abstract:
- content: "<p>This document attempts to provide a list of the frequently asked questions
    (FAQs) posed by IETF meeting attendees regarding travel logistics and local information.
    \ It is intended to assist those who are willing to provide local information,
    so that if they wish to pre-populate answers to some or all of these questions
    either in the IETF wiki or a meeting-specific site, they have a reasonably complete
    list of ideas to draw from.  It is not meant as a list of required information
    that the host or Secretariat needs to provide; it merely serves as a guideline.
    \ This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published
    for informational purposes.</p>"
