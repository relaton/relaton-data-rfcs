abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies the initial version of a YANG module "iana-tunnel-type",
    which contains a collection of IANA-maintained YANG identities used as interface
    types for tunnel interfaces. The module reflects the "tunnelType" registry maintained
    by IANA. The latest revision of this YANG module can be obtained from the IANA
    website.</p><p>Tunnel type values are not directly added to the Tunnel Interface
    Types YANG module; they must instead be added to the "tunnelType" IANA registry.
    Once a new tunnel type registration is made by IANA for a new tunneling scheme
    or even an existing one that is not already listed in the current registry (e.g.,
    LISP, NSH), IANA will update the Tunnel Interface Types YANG module accordingly.</p><p>Some
    of the IETF-defined tunneling techniques are not listed in the current IANA registry.
    It is not the intent of this document to update the existing IANA registry with
    a comprehensive list of tunnel technologies. Registrants must follow the IETF
    registration procedure for interface types whenever a new tunnel type is needed.</p>
