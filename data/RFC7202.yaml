abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo discusses the problem of securing real-time multimedia sessions.
    \ It also explains why the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) and the associated
    RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) do not mandate a single media security mechanism.
    \ This is relevant for designers and reviewers of future RTP extensions to ensure
    that appropriate security mechanisms are mandated and that any such mechanisms
    are specified in a manner that conforms with the RTP architecture.</p>"
