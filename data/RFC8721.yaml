abstract:
- content: "<p>Contributors grant intellectual property rights to the IETF.  The IETF
    Trust holds and manages those rights on behalf of the IETF.  The Trustees of the
    IETF Trust are responsible for that management.  This management includes granting
    the licenses to copy, implement, and otherwise use IETF Contributions, among them
    Internet-Drafts and RFCs.  The Trustees of the IETF Trust accept direction from
    the IETF regarding the rights to be granted.  This document describes the desires
    of the IETF regarding outbound rights to be granted in IETF Contributions.  This
    document obsoletes RFC 5377 solely for the purpose of removing references to the
    IETF Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC), which was part of the IETF Administrative
    Support Activity (IASA).</p>"
