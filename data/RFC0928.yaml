abstract:
- content: <p>The broad outline of the Host-Front End Protocol introduced here and
    described in RFC-929 is the result of the deliberations of a number of experienced
    H-FP designers, who sat as a committee of the DoD Protocol Standards Technical
    Panel. It is the intent of the designers that the protocol be subjected to multiple
    test implementations and probable iteration before being agreed upon as any sort
    of "standard". Therefore, the first order of business is to declare that THIS
    IS A PROPOSAL, NOT A FINAL STANDARD, and the second order of business is to request
    that any readers of these documents who are able to do test implementations (a)
    do so and (b) coordinate their efforts with the author. This RFC suggests a proposed
    protocol for the ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions
    for improvements.</p>
