abstract:
- content: "<p>This document aims at establishing a common understanding about a set
    of scenarios that can be used as a base for the evaluation of different information-centric
    networking (ICN) approaches so that they can be tested and compared against each
    other while showcasing their own advantages. Towards this end, we review the ICN
    literature and document scenarios which have been considered in previous performance
    evaluation studies. We discuss a variety of aspects that an ICN solution can address.
    This includes general aspects, such as, network efficiency, reduced complexity,
    increased scalability and reliability, mobility support, multicast and caching
    performance, real-time communication efficiency, energy consumption frugality,
    and disruption and delay tolerance. We detail ICN-specific aspects as well, such
    as information security and trust, persistence, availability, provenance, and
    location independence.</p><p>This document is a product of the IRTF Information-Centric
    Networking Research Group (ICNRG).</p>"
