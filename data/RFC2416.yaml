abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo is to document a simple experiment. The experiment showed
    that in the case of a TCP receiver behind a 9600 bps modem link at the edge of
    a fast Internet where there are only 3 buffers before the modem (and the fourth
    packet of a four-packet start will surely be dropped), no significant degradation
    in performance is experienced by a TCP sending with a four-packet start when compared
    with a normal slow start (which starts with just one packet). This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.</p>"
