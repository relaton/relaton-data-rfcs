abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a mechanism for usage of SCTP (the Stream Control
    Transmission Protocol) as the transport mechanism between SIP (Session Initiation
    Protocol) entities.  SCTP is a new protocol that provides several features that
    may prove beneficial for transport between SIP entities that exchange a large
    amount of messages, including gateways and proxies.  As SIP is transport-independent,
    support of SCTP is a relatively straightforward process, nearly identical to support
    for TCP. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
