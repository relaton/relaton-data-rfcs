abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of this RFC is to focus discussion on a particular problem
    in the ARPA-Internet and possible methods of solution. Most prior work on congestion
    in datagram systems focuses on buffer management. In this memo the case of a packet
    switch with infinite storage is considered. Such a packet switch can never run
    out of buffers. It can, however, still become congested. The meaning of congestion
    in an infinite-storage system is explored. An unexpected result is found that
    shows a datagram network with infinite storage, first-in-first-out queuing, at
    least two packet switches, and a finite packet lifetime will, under overload,
    drop all packets. By attacking the problem of congestion for the infinite-storage
    case, new solutions applicable to switches with finite storage may be found. No
    proposed solutions this document are intended as standards for the ARPA-Internet
    at this time.</p>"
