abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses a flaw in some of the currently distributed
    name resolver clients. The flaw exposes a security weakness related to the search
    heuristic invoked by these same resolvers when users provide a partial domain
    name, and which is easy to exploit. This document points out the flaw, a case
    in point, and a solution. This memo provides information for the Internet community.
    It does not specify an Internet standard.</p>"
