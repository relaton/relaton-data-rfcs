abstract:
- content: "<p>The SIP Reason header field is defined to carry ISUP (ISDN User Part)
    cause values as well as SIP response codes.  Some services in SIP networks may
    need to know the ISUP location where the call was released in the PSTN (Public
    Switched Telephone Network) to correctly interpret the reason of release.  This
    document updates RFC 3326 by adding a location parameter for this purpose.</p>"
