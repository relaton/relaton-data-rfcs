abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a number of changes to the Policy Core Information
    Model (PCIM, RFC 3060).  Two types of changes are included.  First, several completely
    new elements are introduced, for example, classes for header filtering, that extend
    PCIM into areas that it did not previously cover.  Second, there are cases where
    elements of PCIM (for example, policy rule priorities) are deprecated, and replacement
    elements are defined (in this case, priorities tied to associations that refer
    to policy rules).  Both types of changes are done in such a way that, to the extent
    possible, interoperability with implementations of the original PCIM model is
    preserved.  This document updates RFC 3060. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
