abstract:
- content: "<p>This document comes in two parts. The first part is for regular people
    who wish to set up their own DUAs (Directory User Interfaces) to access the Directory.
    The second part is for ISODE-maintainers wishing to provide portable DUAs to users.
    This part gives instructions in a similar but longer, step-by-step format. This
    memo provides information for the Internet community. It does not specify an Internet
    standard.</p>"
