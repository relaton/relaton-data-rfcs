abstract:
- content: "<p>This document comes in two parts.  The first part is for regular people
    who wish to set up their own DUAs (Directory User Interfaces) to access the Directory.
    \ The second part is for ISODE-maintainers wishing to provide portable DUAs to
    users.  This part gives instructions in a similar but longer, step-by-step format.
    \ This memo provides information for the Internet community.  It does not specify
    an Internet standard.</p>"
