abstract:
- content: <p>Mostly Pointless Lamp Switching (MPLampS) is an architecture for carrying
    electricity over IP (with an MPLS control plane). According to our marketing department,
    MPLampS has the potential to dramatically lower the price, ease the distribution
    and usage, and improve the manageability of delivering electricity. This document
    is motivated by such work as SONET/SDH over IP/MPLS (with apologies to the authors).
    Readers of the previous work have been observed scratching their heads and muttering,
    "What next?". This document answers that question. This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.</p>
