abstract:
- content: "<p>The subtle way in which the IPv6 and IPv4 protocols coexist in typical
    networks, together with the lack of proper IPv6 support in popular Virtual Private
    Network (VPN) tunnel products, may inadvertently result in VPN tunnel traffic
    leakages.  That is, traffic meant to be transferred over an encrypted and integrity-
    protected VPN tunnel may leak out of such a tunnel and be sent in the clear on
    the local network towards the final destination.  This document discusses some
    scenarios in which such VPN tunnel traffic leakages may occur as a result of employing
    IPv6-unaware VPN software.  Additionally, this document offers possible mitigations
    for this issue.</p>"
