abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF makes heavy use of email lists to conduct its work.  This
    often involves accessing the archived history of those email lists.  Participants
    would like to have the ability to browse and search those archives using standard
    IMAP clients.  This memo captures the requirements for providing a service that
    would allow such browsing and searching, and it is intended as input to a later
    activity for the design and development of such a service.</p>"
