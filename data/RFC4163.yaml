abstract:
- content: "<p>This document contains requirements on the TCP/IP header compression
    scheme (profile) to be developed by the RObust Header Compression (ROHC) Working
    Group.  The document discusses the scope of TCP compression, performance considerations,
    assumptions about the surrounding environment, as well as Intellectual Property
    Rights concerns.  The structure of this document is inherited from RFC 3096, which
    defines IP/UDP/RTP requirements for ROHC.  This memo provides information for
    the Internet community.</p>"
