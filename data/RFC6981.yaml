abstract:
- content: <p>This document presents an illustrative framework for providing fast
    reroute in an IP or MPLS network through encapsulation and forwarding to "not-via"
    addresses. The general approach described here uses a single level of encapsulation
    and could be used to protect unicast, multicast, and LDP traffic against link,
    router, and shared risk group failure, regardless of network topology and metrics.</p><p>The
    mechanisms presented in this document are purely illustrative of the general approach
    and do not constitute a protocol specification. The document represents a snapshot
    of the work of the Routing Area Working Group at the time of publication and is
    published as a document of record. Further work is needed before implementation
    or deployment.</p>
