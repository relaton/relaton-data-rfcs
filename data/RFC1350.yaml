- content: "<p>TFTP is a very simple protocol used to transfer files. It is from this
    that its name comes, Trivial File Transfer Protocol or TFTP. Each nonterminal
    packet is acknowledged separately. This document describes the protocol and its
    types of packets. The document also explains the reasons behind some of the design
    decisions. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
