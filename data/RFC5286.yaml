abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the use of loop-free alternates to provide
    local protection for unicast traffic in pure IP and MPLS/LDP networks in the event
    of a single failure, whether link, node, or shared risk link group (SRLG).  The
    goal of this technology is to reduce the packet loss that happens while routers
    converge after a topology change due to a failure.  Rapid failure repair is achieved
    through use of precalculated backup next-hops that are loop-free and safe to use
    until the distributed network convergence process completes.  This simple approach
    does not require any support from other routers.  The extent to which this goal
    can be met by this specification is dependent on the topology of the network.
