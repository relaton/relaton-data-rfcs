abstract:
- content: <p>The Dynamic Source Routing protocol (DSR) is a simple and efficient
    routing protocol designed specifically for use in multi-hop wireless ad hoc networks
    of mobile nodes.  DSR allows the network to be completely self-organizing and
    self-configuring, without the need for any existing network infrastructure or
    administration.  The protocol is composed of the two main mechanisms of "Route
    Discovery" and "Route Maintenance", which work together to allow nodes to discover
    and maintain routes to arbitrary destinations in the ad hoc network.  All aspects
    of the protocol operate entirely on demand, allowing the routing packet overhead
    of DSR to scale automatically to only what is needed to react to changes in the
    routes currently in use.  The protocol allows multiple routes to any destination
    and allows each sender to select and control the routes used in routing its packets,
    for example, for use in load balancing or for increased robustness.  Other advantages
    of the DSR protocol include easily guaranteed loop-free routing, operation in
    networks containing unidirectional links, use of only "soft state" in routing,
    and very rapid recovery when routes in the network change.  The DSR protocol is
    designed mainly for mobile ad hoc networks of up to about two hundred nodes and
    is designed to work well even with very high rates of mobility.  This document
    specifies the operation of the DSR protocol for routing unicast IPv4 packets.  This
    memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</p>
