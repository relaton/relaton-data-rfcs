abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo suggests a simple method for workstations to dynamically
    access mail from a discussion group server, as an extension to an earlier memo
    which dealt with dynamically accessing mail from a mailbox server using the Post
    Office Protocol - Version 3 (POP3).  This RFC specifies a proposed protocol for
    the Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.
    \ All of the extensions described in this memo to the POP3 are OPTIONAL.</p>"
