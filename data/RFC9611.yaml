abstract:
- content: "<p>In order to increase the bandwidth of IPsec traffic between peers,
    this document defines one Notify Message Status Types and one Notify Message Error
    Types payload for the Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2) to support
    the negotiation of multiple Child Security Associations (SAs) with the same Traffic
    Selectors used on different resources, such as CPUs.</p><p>The SA_RESOURCE_INFO
    notification is used to convey information that the negotiated Child SA and subsequent
    new Child SAs with the same Traffic Selectors are a logical group of Child SAs
    where most or all of the Child SAs are bound to a specific resource, such as a
    specific CPU. The TS_MAX_QUEUE notify conveys that the peer is unwilling to create
    more additional Child SAs for this particular negotiated Traffic Selector combination.</p><p>Using
    multiple Child SAs with the same Traffic Selectors has the benefit that each resource
    holding the Child SA has its own Sequence Number Counter, ensuring that CPUs don't
    have to synchronize their cryptographic state or disable their packet replay protection.</p>"
