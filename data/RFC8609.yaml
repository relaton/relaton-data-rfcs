abstract:
- content: "<p>Content-Centric Networking (CCNx) is a network protocol that uses a
    hierarchical name to forward requests and to match responses to requests. This
    document specifies the encoding of CCNx messages in a TLV packet format, including
    the TLV types used by each message element and the encoding of each value. The
    semantics of CCNx messages follow the encoding-independent CCNx Semantics specification.</p><p>This
    document is a product of the Information Centric Networking research group (ICNRG).
    The document received wide review among ICNRG participants and has two full implementations
    currently in active use, which have informed the technical maturity of the protocol
    specification.</p>"
