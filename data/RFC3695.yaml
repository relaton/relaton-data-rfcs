abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces some Forward Error Correction (FEC) schemes
    that supplement the FEC schemes described in RFC 3452.  The primary benefits of
    these additional FEC schemes are that they are designed for reliable bulk delivery
    of large objects using a more compact FEC Payload ID, and they can be used to
    sequentially deliver blocks of an object of indeterminate length.  Thus, they
    more flexibly support different delivery models with less packet header overhead.
    \ This document also describes the Fully-Specified FEC scheme corresponding to
    FEC Encoding ID 0.  This Fully-Specified FEC scheme requires no FEC coding and
    is introduced primarily to allow simple interoperability testing between different
    implementations of protocol instantiations that use the FEC building block.  This
    memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</p>"
