abstract:
- content: "<p>As the demand for high-performance mail delivery agents increases,
    it becomes apparent that single-machine solutions are inadequate to the task,
    both because of capacity limits and that the failure of the single machine means
    a loss of mail delivery for all users.  It is preferable to allow many machines
    to share the responsibility of mail delivery.  The Mailbox Update (MUPDATE) protocol
    allows a group of Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) or Post Office Protocol
    - Version 3 (POP3) servers to function with a unified mailbox namespace.  This
    document is intended to serve as a reference guide to that protocol.</p>"
