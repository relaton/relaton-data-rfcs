abstract:
- content: '<p>The REGISTER function is used in a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
    system primarily to associate a temporary contact address with an address-of-record.  This
    contact is generally in the form of a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), such
    as Contact:  and is generally dynamic and associated with the IP address or hostname
    of the SIP User Agent (UA).  The problem is that network topology may have one
    or more SIP proxies between the UA and the registrar, such that any request traveling
    from the user''s home network to the registered UA must traverse these proxies.  The
    REGISTER method does not give us a mechanism to discover and record this sequence
    of proxies in the registrar for future use.  This document defines an extension
    header field, "Path" which provides such a mechanism. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>'
