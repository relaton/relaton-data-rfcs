abstract:
- content: "<p>In the basic Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) specification, a Mobile Node
    (MN) is assigned with a Home Network Prefix (HNP) during its initial attachment,
    and the MN configures its Home Address (HoA) with the HNP. During the movement
    of the MN, the HNP remains unchanged to keep ongoing communications associated
    with the HoA. However, the current PMIPv6 specification does not specify related
    operations when HNP renumbering has occurred (e.g., due to change of service provider
    or site topology, etc.). In this document, a solution to support HNP renumbering
    is proposed, as an optional extension of the PMIPv6 specification.</p>"
