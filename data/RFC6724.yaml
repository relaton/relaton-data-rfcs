abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes two algorithms, one for source address selection
    and one for destination address selection. The algorithms specify default behavior
    for all Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) implementations. They do not override
    choices made by applications or upper-layer protocols, nor do they preclude the
    development of more advanced mechanisms for address selection. The two algorithms
    share a common context, including an optional mechanism for allowing administrators
    to provide policy that can override the default behavior. In dual-stack implementations,
    the destination address selection algorithm can consider both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
    -- depending on the available source addresses, the algorithm might prefer IPv6
    addresses over IPv4 addresses, or vice versa.</p><p>Default address selection
    as defined in this specification applies to all IPv6 nodes, including both hosts
    and routers. This document obsoletes RFC 3484. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
