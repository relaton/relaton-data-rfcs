abstract:
- content: <p>Many resources provided on the Web are part of sets of resources that
    are provided in a context that is managed by one particular service provider.  Often,
    these sets of resources are referred to as "Web services" or "Web APIs".  This
    specification defines link relations that represent relationships from Web services
    or APIs to resources that provide documentation, descriptions, metadata, or status
    information for these resources.  Documentation is primarily intended for human
    consumers, whereas descriptions are primarily intended for automated consumers.  Metadata
    provides information about a service's context.  This specification also defines
    a link relation to identify status resources that are used to represent information
    about service status.</p>
