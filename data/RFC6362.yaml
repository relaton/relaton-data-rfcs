abstract:
- content: "<p>The Electronic Data Interchange - Internet Integration (EDIINT) AS1,
    AS2, and AS3 messages were designed specifically for the transport of EDI documents.
    \ Since multiple interchanges could be placed within a single EDI document, there
    was not a need for sending multiple EDI documents in a single message.  As adoption
    of EDIINT grew, other uses developed aside from single EDI document transport.
    \ Some transactions required multiple attachments to be interpreted together and
    stored in a single message.  This Informational RFC describes how multiple documents,
    including non-EDI payloads, can be attached and transmitted in a single EDIINT
    transport message.  The attachments are stored within the MIME multipart/related
    structure.  A minimal list of content-types to be supported as attachments is
    provided.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it
    is published for informational purposes.</p>"
