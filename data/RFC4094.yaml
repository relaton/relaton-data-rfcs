abstract:
- content: "<p>This document reviews some of the existing Quality of Service (QoS)
    signaling protocols for an IP network.  The goal here is to learn from them and
    to avoid common misconceptions.  Further, we need to avoid mistakes during the
    design and implementation of any new protocol in this area.  This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.</p>"
