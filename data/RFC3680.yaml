abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) event package
    for registrations.  Through its REGISTER method, SIP allows a user agent to create,
    modify, and delete registrations.  Registrations can also be altered by administrators
    in order to enforce policy.  As a result, these registrations represent a piece
    of state in the network that can change dynamically.  There are many cases where
    a user agent would like to be notified of changes in this state.  This event package
    defines a mechanism by which those user agents can request and obtain such notifications.
