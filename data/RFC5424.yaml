abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the syslog protocol, which is used to convey
    event notification messages. This protocol utilizes a layered architecture, which
    allows the use of any number of transport protocols for transmission of syslog
    messages. It also provides a message format that allows vendor-specific extensions
    to be provided in a structured way.</p><p>This document has been written with
    the original design goals for traditional syslog in mind. The need for a new layered
    specification has arisen because standardization efforts for reliable and secure
    syslog extensions suffer from the lack of a Standards-Track and transport-independent
    RFC. Without this document, each other standard needs to define its own syslog
    packet format and transport mechanism, which over time will introduce subtle compatibility
    issues. This document tries to provide a foundation that syslog extensions can
    build on. This layered architecture approach also provides a solid basis that
    allows code to be written once for each syslog feature rather than once for each
    transport. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
