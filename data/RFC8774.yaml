abstract:
- content: '<p>The age of quantum networking is upon us, and with it comes "entanglement":
    a procedure in which a state (i.e., a bit) can be transferred instantly, with
    no measurable delay between peers. This will lead to a perceived round-trip time
    of zero seconds on some Internet paths, a capability which was not predicted and
    so not included as a possibility in many protocol specifications. Worse than the
    millennium bug, this unexpected value is bound to cause serious Internet failures
    unless the specifications are fixed in time.</p>'
