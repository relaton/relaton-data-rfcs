abstract:
- content: "<p>This RFC discusses some experiments in clock synchronization in the
    ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.
    \ One of the services frequently neglected in computer network design is a high-quality,
    time-of-day clock capable of generating accurate timestamps with small errors
    compared to one-way network delays.  Such a service would be useful for tracing
    the progress of complex transactions, synchronizing cached data bases, monitoring
    network performance and isolating problems.  In this memo one such clock service
    design will be described and its performance assessed.  This design has been incorporated
    as an integral part of the network routing and control protocols of the Distributed
    Computer Network (DCnet) architecture.</p>"
