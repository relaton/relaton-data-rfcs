abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification extends the Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning
    (WebDAV) Protocol to support the server-side ordering of collection members.  Of
    particular interest are orderings that are not based on property values, and so
    cannot be achieved using a search protocol's ordering option and cannot be maintained
    automatically by the server.  Protocol elements are defined to let clients specify
    the position in the ordering of each collection member, as well as the semantics
    governing the ordering.</p>"
