abstract:
- content: <p>This memo describes per-packet stateless strict and loose path steered
    replication and forwarding for "Bit Index Explicit Replication" (BIER) packets
    (RFC 8279); it is called "Tree Engineering for Bit Index Explicit Replication"
    (BIER-TE) and is intended to be used as the path steering mechanism for Traffic
    Engineering with BIER.</p><p>BIER-TE introduces a new semantic for "bit positions"
    (BPs). These BPs indicate adjacencies of the network topology, as opposed to (non-TE)
    BIER in which BPs indicate "Bit-Forwarding Egress Routers" (BFERs). A BIER-TE
    "packets BitString" therefore indicates the edges of the (loop-free) tree across
    which the packets are forwarded by BIER-TE. BIER-TE can leverage BIER forwarding
    engines with little changes. Co-existence of BIER and BIER-TE forwarding in the
    same domain is possible -- for example, by using separate BIER "subdomains" (SDs).
    Except for the optional routed adjacencies, BIER-TE does not require a BIER routing
    underlay and can therefore operate without depending on a routing protocol such
    as the "Interior Gateway Protocol" (IGP).</p>
