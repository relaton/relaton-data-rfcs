abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a model of information needed by the Routing
    and Wavelength Assignment (RWA) process in Wavelength Switched Optical Networks
    (WSONs).  The purpose of the information described in this model is to facilitate
    constrained optical path computation in WSONs.  This model takes into account
    compatibility constraints between WSON signal attributes and network elements
    but does not include constraints due to optical impairments.  Aspects of this
    information that may be of use to other technologies utilizing a GMPLS control
    plane are discussed.</p>"
