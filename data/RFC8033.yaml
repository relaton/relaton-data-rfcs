abstract:
- content: <p>Bufferbloat is a phenomenon in which excess buffers in the network cause
    high latency and latency variation. As more and more interactive applications
    (e.g., voice over IP, real-time video streaming, and financial transactions) run
    in the Internet, high latency and latency variation degrade application performance.
    There is a pressing need to design intelligent queue management schemes that can
    control latency and latency variation, and hence provide desirable quality of
    service to users.</p><p>This document presents a lightweight active queue management
    design called "PIE" (Proportional Integral controller Enhanced) that can effectively
    control the average queuing latency to a target value. Simulation results, theoretical
    analysis, and Linux testbed results have shown that PIE can ensure low latency
    and achieve high link utilization under various congestion situations. The design
    does not require per-packet timestamps, so it incurs very little overhead and
    is simple enough to implement in both hardware and software.</p>
