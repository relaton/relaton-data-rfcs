abstract:
- content: "<p>This document examines the various longer term trends visible within
    the characteristics of the Internet's BGP table and identifies a number of operational
    practices and protocol factors that contribute to these trends. The potential
    impacts of these practices and protocol properties on the scaling properties of
    the inter-domain routing space are examined. This memo provides information for
    the Internet community.</p>"
