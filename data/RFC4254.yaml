abstract:
- content: "<p>Secure Shell (SSH) is a protocol for secure remote login and other
    secure network services over an insecure network.</p><p>This document describes
    the SSH Connection Protocol. It provides interactive login sessions, remote execution
    of commands, forwarded TCP/IP connections, and forwarded X11 connections. All
    of these channels are multiplexed into a single encrypted tunnel.</p><p>The SSH
    Connection Protocol has been designed to run on top of the SSH transport layer
    and user authentication protocols. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
