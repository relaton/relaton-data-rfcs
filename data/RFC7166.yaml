abstract:
- content: "<p>Currently, OSPF for IPv6 (OSPFv3) uses IPsec as the only mechanism
    for authenticating protocol packets. This behavior is different from authentication
    mechanisms present in other routing protocols (OSPFv2, Intermediate System to
    Intermediate System (IS-IS), RIP, and Routing Information Protocol Next Generation
    (RIPng)). In some environments, it has been found that IPsec is difficult to configure
    and maintain and thus cannot be used. This document defines an alternative mechanism
    to authenticate OSPFv3 protocol packets so that OSPFv3 does not depend only upon
    IPsec for authentication.</p><p>The OSPFv3 Authentication Trailer was originally
    defined in RFC 6506. This document obsoletes RFC 6506 by providing a revised definition,
    including clarifications and refinements of the procedures.</p>"
