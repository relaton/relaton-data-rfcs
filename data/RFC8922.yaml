abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a survey of commonly used or notable network
    security protocols, with a focus on how they interact and integrate with applications
    and transport protocols.  Its goal is to supplement efforts to define and catalog
    Transport Services by describing the interfaces required to add security protocols.
    \ This survey is not limited to protocols developed within the scope or context
    of the IETF, and those included represent a superset of features a Transport Services
    system may need to support.</p>"
