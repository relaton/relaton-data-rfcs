abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses the existence of a globally unique public name
    space in the Internet called the DNS (Domain Name System). This name space is
    a hierarchical name space derived from a single, globally unique root. It is a
    technical constraint inherent in the design of the DNS. One root must be supported
    by a set of coordinated root servers administered by a unique naming authority.
    It is not technically feasible for there to be more than one root in the public
    DNS. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
