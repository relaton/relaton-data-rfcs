abstract:
- content: "<p>As IPv6 deployment increases, there will be a dramatic increase in
    the need to use IPv6 addresses in text. While the IPv6 address architecture in
    Section 2.2 of RFC 4291 describes a flexible model for text representation of
    an IPv6 address, this flexibility has been causing problems for operators, system
    engineers, and users. This document defines a canonical textual representation
    format. It does not define a format for internal storage, such as within an application
    or database. It is expected that the canonical format will be followed by humans
    and systems when representing IPv6 addresses as text, but all implementations
    must accept and be able to handle any legitimate RFC 4291 format. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
