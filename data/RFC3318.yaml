abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a set of PRovisioning Classes (PRCs) and textual
    conventions that are common to all clients that provision policy using Common
    Open Policy Service (COPS) protocol for Provisioning.</p><p>Structure of Policy
    Provisioning Information (SPPI) describes a structure for specifying policy information
    that can then be transmitted to a network device for the purpose of configuring
    policy at that device. The model underlying this structure is one of well-defined
    (PRCs) and instances of these classes (PRIs) residing in a virtual information
    store called the Policy Information Base (PIB).</p><p>One way to provision policy
    is by means of the (COPS) protocol with the extensions for provisioning. This
    protocol supports multiple clients, each of which may provision policy for a specific
    policy domain such as QoS, virtual private networks, or security.</p><p>As described
    in COPS usage for Policy Provisioning (COPS-PR), each client supports a non-overlapping
    and independent set of PIB modules. However, some PRovisioning Classes are common
    to all subject-categories (client-types) and need to be present in each.</p>"
