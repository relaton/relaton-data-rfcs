abstract:
- content: "<p>A stateful Path Computation Element (PCE) maintains information on
    the current network state received from the Path Computation Clients (PCCs), including
    computed Label Switched Paths (LSPs), reserved resources within the network, and
    pending path computation requests. This information may then be considered when
    computing the path for a new traffic-engineered LSP or for any associated/dependent
    LSPs. The path-computation response from a PCE helps the PCC to gracefully establish
    the computed LSP.</p><p>The Hierarchical Path Computation Element (H-PCE) architecture
    allows the optimum sequence of interconnected domains to be selected and network
    policy to be applied if applicable, via the use of a hierarchical relationship
    between PCEs.</p><p>Combining the capabilities of stateful PCE and the hierarchical
    PCE would be advantageous. This document describes general considerations and
    use cases for the deployment of stateful, but not stateless, PCEs using the hierarchical
    PCE architecture.</p>"
