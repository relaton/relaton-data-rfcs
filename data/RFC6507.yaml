abstract:
- content: "<p>Many signature schemes currently in use rely on certificates for authentication
    of identity.  In Identity-based cryptography, this adds unnecessary overhead and
    administration.  The Elliptic Curve-based Certificateless Signatures for Identity-based
    Encryption (ECCSI) signature scheme described in this document is certificateless.
    \ This scheme has the additional advantages of low bandwidth and low computational
    requirements.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;
    it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
