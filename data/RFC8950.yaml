abstract:
- content: "<p>Multiprotocol BGP (MP-BGP) specifies that the set of usable next-hop
    address families is determined by the Address Family Identifier (AFI) and the
    Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI). The AFI/SAFI definitions for the
    IPv4 address family only have provisions for advertising a next-hop address that
    belongs to the IPv4 protocol when advertising IPv4 Network Layer Reachability
    Information (NLRI) or VPN-IPv4 NLRI.</p><p>This document specifies the extensions
    necessary to allow the advertising of IPv4 NLRI or VPN-IPv4 NLRI with a next-hop
    address that belongs to the IPv6 protocol. This comprises an extension of the
    AFI/SAFI definitions to allow the address of the next hop for IPv4 NLRI or VPN-IPv4
    NLRI to also belong to the IPv6 protocol, the encoding of the next hop to determine
    which of the protocols the address actually belongs to, and a BGP Capability allowing
    MP-BGP peers to dynamically discover whether they can exchange IPv4 NLRI and VPN-IPv4
    NLRI with an IPv6 next hop. This document obsoletes RFC 5549.</p>"
