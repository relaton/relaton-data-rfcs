abstract:
- content: "<p>Software-Defined Networking (SDN) refers to a new approach for network
    programmability, that is, the capacity to initialize, control, change, and manage
    network behavior dynamically via open interfaces.  SDN emphasizes the role of
    software in running networks through the introduction of an abstraction for the
    data forwarding plane and, by doing so, separates it from the control plane.  This
    separation allows faster innovation cycles at both planes as experience has already
    shown.  However, there is increasing confusion as to what exactly SDN is, what
    the layer structure is in an SDN architecture, and how layers interface with each
    other.  This document, a product of the IRTF Software-Defined Networking Research
    Group (SDNRG), addresses these questions and provides a concise reference for
    the SDN research community based on relevant peer-reviewed literature, the RFC
    series, and relevant documents by other standards organizations.</p>"
