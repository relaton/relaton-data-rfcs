abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of this document is to guide the design of congestion notification
    in any lower-layer or tunnelling protocol that encapsulates IP. The aim is for
    explicit congestion signals to propagate consistently from lower-layer protocols
    into IP. Then, the IP internetwork layer can act as a portability layer to carry
    congestion notification from non-IP-aware congested nodes up to the transport
    layer (L4). Specifications that follow these guidelines, whether produced by the
    IETF or other standards bodies, should assure interworking among IP-layer and
    lower-layer congestion notification mechanisms. This document is included in BCP
    89 and updates the single paragraph of advice to subnetwork designers about Explicit
    Congestion Notification (ECN) in Section 13 of RFC 3819 by replacing it with a
    reference to this document.</p>"
