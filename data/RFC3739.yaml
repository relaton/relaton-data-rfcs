abstract:
- content: "<p>This document forms a certificate profile, based on RFC 3280, for identity
    certificates issued to natural persons.  The profile defines specific conventions
    for certificates that are qualified within a defined legal framework, named Qualified
    Certificates.  However, the profile does not define any legal requirements for
    such Qualified Certificates.  The goal of this document is to define a certificate
    profile that supports the issuance of Qualified Certificates independent of local
    legal requirements.  The profile is however not limited to Qualified Certificates
    and further profiling may facilitate specific local needs. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
