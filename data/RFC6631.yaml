abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet Key Exchange protocol version 2 (IKEv2) does not allow
    secure peer authentication when using short credential strings, i.e., passwords.
    \ Several proposals have been made to integrate password-authentication protocols
    into IKE.  This document provides an adaptation of Password Authenticated Connection
    Establishment (PACE) to the setting of IKEv2 and demonstrates the advantages of
    this integration.  This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet
    community.</p>"
