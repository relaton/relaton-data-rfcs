abstract:
- content: "<p>Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) has been extended to encompass
    point-to-multipoint (P2MP) Label Switched Paths (LSPs). As with point-to-point
    MPLS LSPs, the requirement to detect, handle, and diagnose control and data plane
    defects is critical.</p><p>For operators deploying services based on P2MP MPLS
    LSPs, the detection and specification of how to handle those defects are important
    because such defects not only may affect the fundamentals of an MPLS network,
    but also may impact service level specification commitments for customers of their
    network.</p><p>This document describes requirements for data plane operations
    and management for P2MP MPLS LSPs. These requirements apply to all forms of P2MP
    MPLS LSPs, and include P2MP Traffic Engineered (TE) LSPs and multicast LSPs. This
    memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
