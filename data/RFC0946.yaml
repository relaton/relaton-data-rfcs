abstract:
- content: "<p>Many systems provide a mechanism for finding out where a user is logged
    in from usually including information about telephone extension and office occupants
    names. The information is useful for physically locating people and/or calling
    them on the phone. In 1982 CMU designed and implemented a terminal location database
    and modified existing network software to handle a 64-bit number called the Terminal
    Location Number (or TTYLOC). It now seems appropriate to incorporate this mechanism
    into the TCP-based network protocol family. The mechanism is not viewed as a replacement
    for the Terminal Location Telnet Option (SEND-LOCATION) but as a shorthand mechansim
    for communicating terminal location information between hosts in a localized community.
    This RFC proposes a new option for Telnet for the ARPA-Internet community, and
    requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.</p>"
