abstract:
- content: <p>This document focuses exclusively on the problems associated with extending
    the MARS model to cover multiple clusters or clusters spanning more than one subnet.  It
    describes a hypothetical solution, dubbed "Very Extensive NonUnicast Service"
    (VENUS), and shows how complex such a service would be.  This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.  This memo does not specify an Internet standard of
    any kind.</p>
