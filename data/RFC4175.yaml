abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo specifies a packetization scheme for encapsulating uncompressed
    video into a payload format for the Real-time Transport Protocol, RTP. It supports
    a range of standard- and high-definition video formats, including common television
    formats such as ITU BT.601, and standards from the Society of Motion Picture and
    Television Engineers (SMPTE), such as SMPTE 274M and SMPTE 296M. The format is
    designed to be applicable and extensible to new video formats as they are developed.
