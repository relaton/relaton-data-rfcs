abstract:
- content: "<p>The goal of this document is to describe the potential benefits of
    applications using a transport that enables Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN).
    \ The document outlines the principal gains in terms of increased throughput,
    reduced delay, and other benefits when ECN is used over a network path that includes
    equipment that supports Congestion Experienced (CE) marking.  It also discusses
    challenges for successful deployment of ECN.  It does not propose new algorithms
    to use ECN nor does it describe the details of implementation of ECN in endpoint
    devices (Internet hosts), routers, or other network devices.</p>"
