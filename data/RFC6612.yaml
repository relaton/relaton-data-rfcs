abstract:
- content: "<p>The use of Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) and Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) in the
    same network requires some care. This document discusses scenarios where such
    mixed usage is appropriate and points out the need for interaction between the
    two mechanisms. Solutions and recommendations to enable these scenarios are also
    described. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it
    is published for informational purposes.</p>"
