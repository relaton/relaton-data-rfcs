abstract:
- content: <p>This memo documents an optional type of Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)
    area that is somewhat humorously referred to as a "not-so-stubby" area (or NSSA).  NSSAs
    are similar to the existing OSPF stub area configuration option but have the additional
    capability of importing AS external routes in a limited fashion.  The OSPF NSSA
    Option was originally defined in RFC 1587.  The functional differences between
    this memo and RFC 1587 are explained in Appendix F.  All differences, while expanding
    capability, are backward-compatible in nature.  Implementations of this memo and
    of RFC 1587 will interoperate. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
