abstract:
- content: <p>This document provides context and a report on the workshop on "Root
    Causes and Mitigation of Name Collisions", which took place in London, United
    Kingdom, from March 8 to 10, 2014.  The main goal of the workshop was to foster
    a discussion on the causes and potential mitigations of domain name collisions.  This
    report provides a small amount of background and context; then, it provides a
    summary of the workshop's discussions.</p>
