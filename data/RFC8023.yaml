- content: <p>This document provides context and a report on the workshop on "Root
    Causes and Mitigation of Name Collisions", which took place in London, United

    a discussion on the causes and potential mitigations of domain name collisions.  This
    report provides a small amount of background and context; then, it provides a
    summary of the workshop's discussions.</p>
