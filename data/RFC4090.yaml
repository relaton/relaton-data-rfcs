abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines RSVP-TE extensions to establish backup label-switched
    path (LSP) tunnels for local repair of LSP tunnels. These mechanisms enable the
    re-direction of traffic onto backup LSP tunnels in 10s of milliseconds, in the
    event of a failure.</p><p>Two methods are defined here. The one-to-one backup
    method creates detour LSPs for each protected LSP at each potential point of local
    repair. The facility backup method creates a bypass tunnel to protect a potential
    failure point; by taking advantage of MPLS label stacking, this bypass tunnel
    can protect a set of LSPs that have similar backup constraints. Both methods can
    be used to protect links and nodes during network failure. The described behavior
    and extensions to RSVP allow nodes to implement either method or both and to interoperate
    in a mixed network. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
