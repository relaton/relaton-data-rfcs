abstract:
- content: "<p>Multi-protocol label switching (MPLS) integrates the label swapping
    forwarding paradigm with network layer routing.  To deliver reliable service,
    MPLS requires a set of procedures to provide protection of the traffic carried
    on different paths.  This requires that the label switching routers (LSRs) support
    fault detection, fault notification, and fault recovery mechanisms, and that MPLS
    signaling support the configuration of recovery.  With these objectives in mind,
    this document specifies a framework for MPLS based recovery.  Restart issues are
    not included in this framework.  This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.</p>"
