    <p>The "Barriers to Internet Access of Services (BIAS)" workshop was
    convened by the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) from January 15-17,
    2024 as a three-day online meeting. Based on the submitted position
    papers, the workshop covered three areas of interest: the role of
    Community Networks in Internet access of services, reports and
    comments on the observed digital divide, and measurements of
    censorship and censorship circumvention. This report summarizes the
    workshop's discussions and serves as a reference for reports on the
    current barriers to Internet access.</p><p>Note that this document is a report on the proceedings of the
    workshop. The views and positions documented in this report were
    expressed during the workshop by participants and do not necessarily
    reflect the IAB's views and positions.</p>
