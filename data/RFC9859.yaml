abstract:
- content: "<p>This document generalizes and extends the use of DNS NOTIFY (RFC 1996)
    beyond conventional zone transfer hints to allow other types of actions that were
    previously lacking a trigger mechanism to be triggered via the DNS. Notifications
    merely nudge the receiver to initiate a predefined action promptly (instead of
    on a schedule); they do not alter the action itself (including any security checks
    it might employ).</p><p>To enable this functionality, a method for discovering
    the receiver endpoint for such notification messages is introduced, via the new
    DSYNC record type. Notification types are recorded in a new registry, with initial
    support for parental NS and DS record updates including DNSSEC bootstrapping.</p>"
