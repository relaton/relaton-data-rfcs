abstract:
- content: "<p>The objective of Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN) is to protect the
    quality of service (QoS) of inelastic flows within a Diffserv domain. The overall
    rate of PCN-traffic is metered on every link in the PCN- domain, and PCN-packets
    are appropriately marked when certain configured rates are exceeded. Egress nodes
    pass information about these PCN-marks to Decision Points that then decide whether
    to admit or block new flow requests or to terminate some already admitted flows
    during serious pre-congestion.</p><p>This document specifies how PCN-marks are
    to be encoded into the IP header by reusing the Explicit Congestion Notification
    (ECN) codepoints within a PCN-domain. The PCN wire protocol for non-IP protocol
    headers will need to be defined elsewhere. Nonetheless, this document clarifies
    the PCN encoding for MPLS in an informational appendix. The encoding for IP provides
    for up to three different PCN marking states using a single Diffserv codepoint
    (DSCP): not-marked (NM), threshold-marked (ThM), and excess-traffic-marked (ETM).
    Hence, it is called the 3-in-1 PCN encoding. This document obsoletes RFC 5696.
