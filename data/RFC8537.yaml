abstract:
- content: "<p>Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) association signaling can be used
    to bind two unidirectional Label Switched Paths (LSPs) into an associated bidirectional
    LSP.  When an associated bidirectional LSP is co-routed, the reverse LSP follows
    the same path as its forward LSP.  This document updates the fast reroute procedures
    defined in RFC 4090 to support both single-sided and double-sided provisioned
    associated bidirectional LSPs.  This document also updates the procedure for associating
    two reverse LSPs defined in RFC 7551 to support co-routed bidirectional LSPs.
    \ The fast reroute procedures can ensure that, for the co-routed LSPs, traffic
    flows on co-routed paths in the forward and reverse directions after a failure
    event.</p>"
