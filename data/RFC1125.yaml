- content: "<p>The purpose of this memo is to focus discussion on particular problems
    in the Internet and possible methods of solution.  No proposed solutions in this
    document are intended as standards for the Internet.  Rather, it is hoped that
    a general consensus will emerge as to the appropriate solution to such problems,
    leading eventually to the development and adoption of standards.</p>"
